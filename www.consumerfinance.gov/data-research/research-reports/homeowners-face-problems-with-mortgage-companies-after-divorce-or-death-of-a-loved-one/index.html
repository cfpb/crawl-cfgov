                <p data-block-key="ikcbg">Each year, people become homeowners following divorce or the death of a spouse or family member, rather than purchasing the home directly. These homeowners could be surviving spouses, adult children who inherit a family home, domestic violence survivors, or recently divorced parents with young children. If there is a mortgage on the home, these homeowners must act quickly to make mortgage payments in order to avoid foreclosure. And the homeowner may in some circumstances wish to assume liability for the mortgage.</p><p data-block-key="dpgqp">This spotlight provides an overview of the most common problems homeowners encounter with mortgage servicing companies after divorce or the death of a loved one, as reported to the CFPB by homeowners. Federal rules and mortgage program guidelines require servicers to help these successor homeowners get the information they need to manage the existing mortgage and, if the homeowner chooses, to assume the existing loan terms. However, CFPB complaints highlight significant challenges with servicers' handling of these requests, including reported delays lasting months or years, as well as allegations that servicers are unnecessarily pressuring homeowners to refinance at higher interest rates rather than helping them manage existing mortgages.</p><h2 id="consumer-risks" data-block-key="kqolv">Consumer Risks</h2><ol><li data-block-key="bqm6h"><b>Pressure to refinance:</b> Homeowners report being incorrectly told that they must refinance the loan at today's higher interest rates, rather than being offered options for managing the existing mortgage. Homeowners describe significant stress at the prospect of not being able to afford a new mortgage, including the possibility of having to uproot their families and move.</li><li data-block-key="f3a4h"><b>Delays:</b> Many homeowners report waiting months or even years for servicers to process their requests, with some reporting that servicers repeatedly request the same documentation or fail altogether to respond to inquiries. When these delays occur, homeowners report incurring legal fees, being at risk of violating their divorce decrees, missing out on lower cost refinance opportunities, and becoming delinquent and facing foreclosure.</li><li data-block-key="bvvsb"><b>Refusals to release the original borrower from liability:</b> Homeowners report that some servicers are blocking requests to release the original borrower from liability, as divorce decrees often require. For homeowners required by court order to remove an ex-spouse from the mortgage, this can lead to being found in violation of the court order or having their property settlement re-opened. Homeowners report this happening even when the successor homeowners demonstrate their ability and willingness to repay the loan.</li><li data-block-key="944sh"><b>Safety risks to survivors of abuse:</b> Domestic violence survivors have reported that servicers continue sending account information to their abusers and require their abusers' consent for account changes, potentially creating safety threats.</li></ol><p data-block-key="708cs">Investors and guarantors of mortgages play a critical oversight role. Based on these findings, investors and servicers can do more to reduce the risk of harm to successor homeowners. Investors should:</p><ol><li data-block-key="8mnji">Ensure that servicers are complying with all applicable law and guidance, including the guidance provided by the federal mortgage agencies.</li><li data-block-key="dcrju">Ensure their policies are not unnecessarily pushing successor homeowners to refinance their mortgages.</li><li data-block-key="bigk7">Examine whether their underwriting requirements are posing an undue obstacle to mortgage assumptions where the successor demonstrates an ability and willingness to pay.</li><li data-block-key="7i2us">Develop, with mortgage servicers, policies and procedures to assist successors in interest who are survivors of domestic violence, with a goal of protecting the safety and property interests of the survivor.</li></ol><p data-block-key="ddb40">Homeowners have the right to clear, consistent, and timely information from mortgage servicers. Homeowners who get the runaround or experience pressure to refinance an existing mortgage on their home should file a complaint with the CFPB.</p><h2 id="background" data-block-key="3bmk0">Background</h2><p data-block-key="7e17l">Each year, people become homeowners following divorce or the death of a spouse or family member, rather than purchasing the home directly. These homeowners may be surviving spouses, adult children, domestic violence survivors, or recently divorced parents with young children seeking to protect their rights to their family home. These individuals are sometimes referred to as successors in interest.</p><p data-block-key="9ota5">If there is a mortgage on the home, these homeowners will need to make sure it is paid in order to avoid foreclosure.<a aria-labelledby="footnotes" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-source-1"><sup>1</sup></a> They may need to know where to send the payments, how much payments are, and what the principal balance and loan terms are. If the mortgage is past due, they may need help avoiding foreclosure. If the homeowner wants to have the original borrower released from liability on the mortgage, as courts often order in divorces, the homeowner will generally need to assume liability for the mortgage after meeting the lender or investor’s underwriting standards.</p><p data-block-key="b51fq">CFPB rules and federal housing program guidelines require mortgage servicers to help these homeowners in a timely way. Mortgage servicers are required to let homeowners know what documents they need to submit to prove their ownership interest and, once that interest is confirmed, treat them like an original borrower on the loan.<a aria-labelledby="footnotes" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-source-2"><sup>2</sup></a> If the homeowner wants to assume liability on the mortgage, and have the original borrower released from liability, the servicer must process that request in a timely way.<a aria-labelledby="footnotes" href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-source-3"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p data-block-key="a3ohe">However, CFPB complaints suggest that some mortgage servicers are making it difficult for surviving spouses and other homeowners to get the help they need. Additionally, in some cases, servicers appear to be pushing homeowners toward unnecessary refinancing.</p><h2 id="homeowner-complaints-suggest-that-servicers-are-failing-to-help-surviving-spouses-and-other-homeowners." data-block-key="5vta7">Homeowner complaints suggest that servicers are failing to help surviving spouses and other homeowners.</h2><p data-block-key="bb22t">A review of CFPB complaints found that homeowners reported that mortgage servicers provide incomplete or inaccurate information or fail to timely process their assumption paperwork.</p><h3 id="servicers-often-pressure-homeowners-to-refinance." data-block-key="fz7ac">Servicers often pressure homeowners to refinance.</h3><p data-block-key="2gj1p">Successor homeowners have a right to continue making the mortgage payments, get information about the loan, and even be evaluated for a loan modification without either assuming liability for the loan or refinancing. If homeowners wish to modify the loan, to change the payment terms or remove the original borrower’s name from the mortgage, homeowners do not generally need to refinance to do so, provided they are willing to assume liability on the loan and can pass the investor’s underwriting criteria for assumptions.<a aria-labelledby="footnotes" href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-source-4"><sup>4</sup></a> Yet homeowners, both those seeking merely to manage the existing mortgage and those seeking to assume liability and modify the mortgage (for example, by changing obligors) report being told that they must refinance the loan at today's higher interest rates. Servicers sometimes even insist on the need to refinance just to remove the name of a deceased spouse from the monthly mortgage statements.</p><p data-block-key="6nqa2">For these homeowners, an unnecessary refinance can increase their interest rate, add additional fees, and drive up their housing costs.</p><p data-block-key="54cnu"><i>A homeowner in Virginia noted:</i></p><blockquote data-block-key="ain4j">“In [month], 2007, my husband and I purchased our home together with both of our names on the property deed… After the unexpected death of my husband in [year]… I have been trying to become a successor in interest to take over the existing mortgage to keep living in the same house raising my minor kids in stable and familiar environment... The mortgage company provided me a list of documents required, and I have submitted those, often multiple times… [W]hen I call them, they give me inconsistent explanations for deficiencies, and then proceed to try to strong-arm me into refinancing the mortgage.”<a aria-labelledby="footnotes" href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-source-5"><sup>5</sup></a></blockquote><h3 id="homeowners-report-that-the-process-to-assume-a-mortgage-can-take-months-or-even-years-and-they-are-often-unable-to-get-any-resolution." data-block-key="m8m39">Homeowners report that the process to assume a mortgage can take months or even years, and they are often unable to get any resolution.</h3><p data-block-key="8v157">Homeowners report that servicers are providing inaccurate or incomplete information; failing to timely respond to requests for information; repeatedly requesting additional or duplicative documentation after the successor has already provided documentation; and are failing to process assumptions. They also report that these issues can be exacerbated when their loan is transferred to a new servicer.</p><p data-block-key="cmqa5"><i>A homeowner in Missouri noted:</i></p><blockquote data-block-key="ddlud">“I have been trying to assume the VA Mortgage Loan of my deceased husband since September 7, 2023.

We currently do not have a program to remove a name from the loan. The Note associated with the obligation to repay the debt was executed by (Deceased Husband 's Name).

Homeowners describe showing months or years of making on-time loan payments from their bank accounts, high credit scores, good income, and lengthy employment histories and still being steered to a costly refinance instead of having their assumption promptly processed.</p><p data-block-key="dq488"><i>A homeowner in Washington noted:</i></p><blockquote data-block-key="u8rm">“I have applied for an assumption loan after a divorce with full cooperation of my ex-husband.

Some servicers falsely claim that investors forbid assumptions and blame investor underwriting requirements or assert that investors do not allow assumptions where a modification is necessary. One servicer admitted cutting off successor homeowners’ account access while processing assumptions due to an ongoing “systems” issue. Servicers assert that delays beyond the timelines provided for in federal guidance are acceptable because of increased processing volumes or because their processing is ongoing. Homeowners also report being denied account access because they are not an “authorized third party” or because they did not pay closing costs for assumption, even when they have provided documents to the servicer showing their ownership of the home.</p><h3 id="homeowners-report-a-range-of-harms-caused-by-servicer-actions." data-block-key="9156q">Homeowners report a range of harms caused by servicer actions.</h3><p data-block-key="btemq">Homeowners who are told that they must refinance into a higher interest loan with associated closing costs report the stress and anxiety caused by the prospect of being unable to afford the new mortgage and potentially losing their home.

These challenges are posing significant risks to these homeowners’ ability to manage the mortgage and protect their home.</p><p data-block-key="7vq8j">Investors and guarantors of mortgages play a critical oversight role. Based on these findings, investors can do more to reduce the risk of harm to successor homeowners. Investors therefore should take the following actions:</p><ol><li data-block-key="302ln"><b>Investors should ensure that servicers are complying with all applicable law and guidance, including the guidance provided by the federal mortgage agencies.</b> The reports from homeowners included in this report suggest that servicers are failing to follow existing guidance from the federal mortgage agencies regarding the treatment of successor homeowners. This appears to be particularly true in terms of guidance regarding assumptions. Consolidated guidance specifically focused on assisting successors in interest could be helpful in clarifying homeowners’ rights.</li><li data-block-key="el3j1"><b>Investors should ensure their policies are not unnecessarily requiring a successor homeowner to refinance the mortgage.</b> Investors should generally examine whether their policies appear to require a refinancing when there are options that are less costly and burdensome to the successor in interest and adequately protect investors’ interests. In particular, investors should examine whether any requirements for removing the name of a deceased borrower from the mortgage loan are posing a barrier to assumption. Servicers are also responsible for assuring that their internal policies and procedures are not creating pressure on homeowners to refinance.</li><li data-block-key="9hbv9"><b>Investors should examine whether underwriting requirements are posing an undue obstacle to mortgage assumptions where the successor demonstrates an ability and willingness to pay.</b> CFPB complaints suggest that many homeowners are not able to take advantage of mortgage assumptions even after demonstrating the ability to continue paying the mortgage. Investors largely control the underwriting standards in place when a homeowner seeks to assume liability on an existing mortgage and release the original borrower from liability. Where a homeowner has already taken over the responsibility of making the mortgage payments, full underwriting of that homeowner may not be necessary. For example, FHA guidelines allow for assumptions by a confirmed successor in interest if the assuming borrower can demonstrate that they have made the mortgage payments for a minimum of six months prior to the date of application of the assumption.<a aria-labelledby="footnotes" href="#footnote-22" id="footnote-source-22"><sup>22</sup></a></li><li data-block-key="9i3uv"><b>Investors and servicers should develop policies and procedures to assist successors in interest who are survivors of domestic violence, with a goal of protecting the safety and property interests of the survivor.</b> For example, investors and servicers should review policies and procedures related to communication with the homeowner to identify whether they inadvertently prevent the survivor from accessing mortgage information, thereby potentially creating risks of delinquency or risks to physical safety.<a aria-labelledby="footnotes" href="#footnote-23" id="footnote-source-23"><sup>23</sup></a> Homeowners facing domestic violence should not be forced from their homes in order to protect their financial information from an abuser or otherwise be put in harm’s way by mortgage servicers.</li></ol><p data-block-key="9o317">Homeowners have the right to clear, consistent and timely information from mortgage servicers.

<h3>107(a) Data Format and Itemization</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-Interp-1" id="107-a-Interp-1"><strong>1. General.</strong> Section 1002.107(a) describes a covered financial institution’s obligation to compile and maintain data regarding the covered applications it receives from small businesses.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-Interp-1-i" id="107-a-Interp-1-i"><strong>i.</strong> A covered financial institution reports these data even if the credit originated pursuant to the reported application was subsequently sold by the institution.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-Interp-1-ii" id="107-a-Interp-1-ii"><strong>ii.</strong> A covered financial institution annually reports data for covered applications for which final action was taken in the previous calendar year.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-Interp-2" id="107-a-Interp-2"><strong>2. Free-form text fields.</strong> A covered financial institution may use technology such as autocorrect and predictive text when requesting applicant-provided data under subpart B of this part that the financial institution reports via free-form text fields, provided that such technology does not restrict the applicant’s ability to write in its own response instead of using text suggested by the technology.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-Interp-3" id="107-a-Interp-3"><strong>3. Filing Instructions Guide.</strong>  Additional details and procedures for compiling data pursuant to §&#160;1002.107 are included in the Filing Instructions Guide, which is available at https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/small-business-lending/filing-instructions-guide/.</p>

<h3>107(a)(1) Unique Identifier</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-1-Interp-1" id="107-a-1-Interp-1"><strong>1. Unique within the financial institution.</strong>  A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(1) by compiling and reporting an alphanumeric application or loan identifier unique within the financial institution to the specific application. The identifier must not exceed 45 characters, and must begin with the financial institution’s Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), as defined in comment 109(b)(6)-1. Separate applications for the same applicant must have separate identifiers. The identifier may only include standard numerical and/or upper-case alphabetical characters and cannot include dashes, other special characters, or characters with diacritics. The financial institution may assign the unique identifier at any time prior to reporting the application. Refinancings or applications for refinancing must be assigned a different identifier than the transaction that is being refinanced. A financial institution with multiple branches must ensure that its branches do not use the same identifiers to refer to multiple applications.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-1-Interp-2" id="107-a-1-Interp-2"><strong>2. Does not include directly identifying information.</strong> The unique identifier must not include any directly identifying information, such as a whole or partial Social Security number or employer identification number, about the applicant or persons (natural or legal) associated with the applicant. See also §&#160;1002.111(c) and related commentary.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="107-a-2-Interp" id="107-a-2-Interp"></div>
<h3>107(a)(2) Application Date</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-2-Interp-1" id="107-a-2-Interp-1"><strong>1. Consistency.</strong> Section 1002.107(a)(2) requires that, in reporting the date of covered application, a financial institution shall report the date the covered application was received or the date shown on a paper or electronic application form. Although a financial institution need not choose the same approach for its entire small business lending application register, it should generally be consistent in its approach by, for example, establishing procedures for how to report this date within particular scenarios, products, or divisions. If the financial institution chooses to report the date shown on an application form and the institution retains multiple versions of the application form, the institution reports the date shown on the first application form satisfying the definition of covered application pursuant to §&#160;1002.103.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-2-Interp-2" id="107-a-2-Interp-2"><strong>2. Application received.</strong> For an application submitted directly to the financial institution or its affiliate (as described in §&#160;1002.107(a)(4)), the financial institution shall report the date it received the covered application, as defined under §&#160;1002.103, or the date shown on a paper or electronic application form. For an application initially submitted to a third party, see comment 107(a)(2)-3.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-2-Interp-3" id="107-a-2-Interp-3"><strong>3. Indirect applications.</strong> For an application that was not submitted directly to the financial institution or its affiliate (as described in §&#160;1002.107(a)(4)), the financial institution shall report the date the application was received by the party that initially received the application, the date the application was received by the financial institution, or the date shown on the application form. Although a financial institution need not choose the same approach for its entire small business lending application register, it should generally be consistent in its approach by, for example, establishing procedures for how to report this date within particular scenarios, products, or divisions.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-2-Interp-4" id="107-a-2-Interp-4"><strong>4. Safe harbor.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1002.112(c)(1), a financial institution that reports on its small business lending application register an application date that is within three business days of the actual application date pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(2) does not violate the Act or subpart B of this part. For purposes of this paragraph, a business day means any day the financial institution is open for business.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="107-a-3-Interp" id="107-a-3-Interp"></div>
<h3>107(a)(3) Application Method</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-3-Interp-1" id="107-a-3-Interp-1"><strong>1. General.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(3) by reporting the means by which the applicant submitted the application from one of the following options: in-person, telephone, online, or mail. If the financial institution retains multiple versions of the application form, the institution reports the means by which the first application form satisfying the definition of covered application pursuant to §&#160;1002.103 was submitted. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-3-Interp-1-i" id="107-a-3-Interp-1-i"><strong>i. In-person.</strong> A financial institution reports the application method as “in-person” if the applicant submitted the application to the financial institution, or to another party acting on the financial institution’s behalf, in person. The in-person application method applies, for example, to applications submitted at a branch office (including applications hand delivered by the applicant), at the applicant’s place of business, or via electronic media with a video component).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-3-Interp-1-ii" id="107-a-3-Interp-1-ii"><strong>ii. Telephone.</strong> A financial institution reports the application method as “telephone” if the applicant submitted the application to the financial institution, or another party acting on the financial institution’s behalf, by telephone call or via audio-based electronic media without a video component.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-3-Interp-1-iii" id="107-a-3-Interp-1-iii"><strong>iii. Online.</strong> A financial institution reports the application method as “online” if the applicant submitted the application to the financial institution, or another party acting on the financial institution’s behalf, through a website, mobile application (app), fax transmission, electronic mail, text message, or some other form of text-based electronic communication. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-3-Interp-1-iv" id="107-a-3-Interp-1-iv"><strong>iv. Mail.</strong> A financial institution reports the application method as “mail” if the applicant submitted the application to the financial institution, or another party acting on the financial institution’s behalf, via United States mail, courier or overnight service, or an overnight drop box.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="107-a-4-Interp" id="107-a-4-Interp"></div>
<h3>107(a)(4) Application Recipient</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-4-Interp-1" id="107-a-4-Interp-1"><strong>1. Agents.</strong> When a financial institution is reporting actions taken by its agent consistent with comment 109(a)(3)-3, the agent is considered the financial institution for the purposes of §&#160;1002.107(a)(4). For example, assume that an applicant submitted an application to Financial Institution B, and Financial Institution B made the credit decision acting as Financial Institution A’s agent under State law. Financial Institution A reports the application and indicates that the application was submitted directly to Financial Institution A.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="107-a-5-Interp" id="107-a-5-Interp"></div>
<h3>107(a)(5) Credit Type</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-5-Interp-1" id="107-a-5-Interp-1"><strong>1. Reporting credit product—in general.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(5)(i) by selecting the credit product applied for or originated, from the list below. If the credit product applied for or originated is not included on this list, the financial institution selects “other,” and reports the credit product via free-form text field. If an applicant requested more than one credit product at the same time, the financial institution reports each credit product requested as a separate application. However, if the applicant only requested a single covered credit transaction, but had not decided on which particular product, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(5)(i) by reporting the credit product originated (if originated), or the credit product denied (if denied), or the credit product of greater interest to the applicant, if readily determinable. If the credit product of greater interest to the applicant is not readily determinable, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(5)(i) by reporting one of the credit products requested as part of the request for a single covered credit transaction, in its discretion. See comment 103(a)-5 for instructions on reporting requests for multiple covered credit transactions at one time.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-5-Interp-2" id="107-a-5-Interp-2"><strong>2. Credit card account, not private-label.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(5)(i) by reporting the credit product as a “credit card account, not private-label” when the product is a business-purpose open-end credit account that is not private label and that may be accessed from time to time by a card, plate, or other single credit device to obtain credit, except that accounts or lines of credit secured by real property and overdraft lines of credit accessed by debit cards are not credit card accounts. The term credit card account does not include debit card accounts or closed-end credit that may be accessed by a card, plate, or single credit device. The term credit card account does include charge card accounts that are generally paid in full each billing period, as well as hybrid prepaid-credit cards. A financial institution reports multiple credit card account, not private-label applications requested at one time using the guidance in comment 103(a)-7.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-5-Interp-3" id="107-a-5-Interp-3"><strong>3. Private-label credit card account.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(5)(i) by reporting the credit product as a “private-label credit card account” when the product is a business-purpose open-end private-label credit account that otherwise meets the description of a credit card account in comment 107(a)(5)-2. A private-label credit card account is a credit card account that can only be used to acquire goods or services provided by one business (for example, a specific merchant, retailer, independent dealer, or manufacturer) or a small group of related businesses. A co-branded or other card that can also be used for purchases at unrelated businesses is not a private-label credit card. A financial institution reports multiple private-label credit card account applications requested at one time in the same manner as credit card account, not private-label applications, using the guidance in comment 103(a)-7.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-5-Interp-4" id="107-a-5-Interp-4"><strong>4. Credit product not provided by the applicant and otherwise undetermined.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(c), a financial institution is required to maintain procedures reasonably designed to collect applicant-provided data, which includes credit product. However, if a financial institution is nonetheless unable to collect or otherwise determine credit product information because the applicant does not indicate what credit product it seeks and the application is denied, withdrawn, or closed for incompleteness before a credit product is identified, the financial institution reports that the credit product is “not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined.” </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-5-Interp-5" id="107-a-5-Interp-5"><strong>5. Reporting credit product involving counteroffers.</strong> If a financial institution presents a counteroffer for a different credit product than the product the applicant had initially requested, and the applicant does not agree to proceed with the counteroffer, the financial institution reports the application for the original credit product as denied pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(9). If the applicant agrees to proceed with consideration of the financial institution’s counteroffer, the financial institution reports the disposition of the application based on the credit product that was offered and does not report the original credit product applied for. See comment 107(a)(9)-2.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-5-Interp-6" id="107-a-5-Interp-6"><strong>6. Other sales-based financing transaction.</strong> For an extension of business credit incident to a factoring arrangement that is otherwise a covered credit transaction, a financial institution selects “other sales-based financing transaction” as the credit product. See comment 104(b)-1.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-5-Interp-7" id="107-a-5-Interp-7"><strong>7. Guarantees.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(5)(ii) by selecting the type or types of guarantees that were obtained for an originated covered credit transaction, or that would have been obtained if the covered credit transaction was originated, from the list below. The financial institution selects, if applicable, up to a maximum of five guarantees for a single application. If the type of guarantee does not appear on the list, the financial institution selects “other” and reports the type of guarantee via free-form text field. If no guarantee is obtained or would have been obtained if the covered credit transaction was originated, the financial institution selects “no guarantee.” If an application is denied, withdrawn, or closed for incompleteness before any guarantee has been identified, the financial institution selects “no guarantee.” The financial institution chooses State government guarantee or local government guarantee, as applicable, based on the entity directly administering the program, not the source of funding.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-5-Interp-8" id="107-a-5-Interp-8"><strong>8. Loan term.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(5)(iii) by reporting the number of months in the loan term for the covered credit transaction. The loan term is the number of months after which the legal obligation will mature or terminate, measured from the date of origination. For transactions involving real property, the financial institution may instead measure the loan term from the date of the first payment period and disregard the time that elapses, if any, between the settlement of the transaction and the first payment period. For example, if a loan closes on April 12, but the first payment is not due until June 1 and includes the interest accrued in May (but not April), the financial institution may choose not to include the month of April in the loan term. In addition, the financial institution may round the loan term to the nearest full month or may count only full months and ignore partial months, as it so chooses. If a credit product, such as a credit card, does not have a loan term, the financial institution reports that the loan term is “not applicable.” The financial institution also reports that the loan term is “not applicable” if the credit product is reported as “not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined.” For a credit product that generally has a loan term, the financial institution reports “not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined” if the application is denied, withdrawn, or determined to be incomplete before a loan term has been identified. For merchant cash advances and other sales-based financing transactions, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(5)(iii) by reporting the loan term, if any, that the financial institution estimated or specified in processing, underwriting or providing disclosures for the application or transaction. If more than one such loan term is estimated or specified, the financial institution reports the one it considers to be most accurate, in its discretion. For merchant cash advances and other sales-based financing transactions that do not have a loan term, the financial institution reports “not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined.”</p>

More than one purpose.</strong> If the applicant indicates or the financial institution is otherwise aware of more than one purpose for the credit applied for or originated, the financial institution reports those purposes, up to a maximum of three, using the list provided, in any order it chooses. For example, if an applicant refinances a commercial building it owns and uses the funds to purchase a motor vehicle and expand the business it runs in a part of that building, the financial institution reports that the three purposes of the credit are purchase, construction/improvement, or refinance of owner-occupied real property; purchase, refinance, or rehabilitation/repair of motor vehicle(s) (including light and heavy trucks); and business expansion. If an application has more than three purposes, the financial institution reports any three of those purposes. In the example above, if the funds were also used to purchase equipment, the financial institution would select only three of the relevant purposes to report.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-6-Interp-3" id="107-a-6-Interp-3"><strong>3. “Other” credit purpose.</strong> If a purpose of an application does not appear on the list of purposes provided, the financial institution reports “other” as the credit purpose and reports the credit purpose via free-form text field. If the application has more than one “other” purpose, the financial institution chooses the most significant “other” purpose, in its discretion, and reports that “other” purpose. The financial institution reports a maximum of three credit purposes, including any “other” purpose.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-6-Interp-4" id="107-a-6-Interp-4"><strong>4. Credit purpose not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(c), a financial institution shall maintain procedures reasonably designed to collect applicant-provided data, which includes credit purpose. However, if a financial institution is nonetheless unable to collect or determine credit purpose information, the financial institution reports that the credit purpose is “not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-6-Interp-5" id="107-a-6-Interp-5"><strong>5.

The financial institution is permitted, but not required, to present the list of credit purposes provided in comment 107(a)(6)-1 to the applicant. The financial institution is also permitted to ask about purposes not included on the list provided in comment 107(a)(6)-1. If the applicant chooses a purpose or purposes not included on the provided list, the financial institution follows the instructions in comment 107(a)(6)-3 regarding reporting of “other” as the credit purpose. If an applicant chooses a purpose or purposes that are similar to purposes on the list provided, but uses different language, the financial institution reports the purpose or purposes from the list provided.</p>

Overdraft.</strong> When overdraft is provided as an aspect of the covered credit transaction applied for or originated, the financial institution reports “Overdraft” as a purpose of the credit. The financial institution reports credit type pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(5)(i) as appropriate for the underlying covered credit transaction, such as “Line of credit—unsecured.” Providing occasional overdraft services as part of a deposit account offering would not be reported for the purpose of subpart B.</p>

<h3>107(a)(7) Amount Applied For</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-7-Interp-1" id="107-a-7-Interp-1"><strong>1. Initial amount requested.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(7) by reporting the initial amount of credit or the initial credit limit requested by the applicant. The financial institution is not required to report credit amounts or limits discussed before an application is made, but must capture the initial amount requested at the application stage. If the applicant requests an amount as a range of numbers, the financial institution reports the midpoint of that range. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-7-Interp-2" id="107-a-7-Interp-2"><strong>2. No amount requested.</strong> If the applicant does not request a specific amount at the application stage, but the financial institution underwrites the application for a specific amount, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(7) by reporting the amount considered for underwriting as the amount applied for. If the particular type of credit product applied for does not involve a specific amount requested, the financial institution reports that the requirement is “not applicable.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-7-Interp-3" id="107-a-7-Interp-3"><strong>3. Firm offers.</strong> When an applicant responds to a “firm offer” that specifies an amount or limit, which may occur in conjunction with a pre-approved credit solicitation, the financial institution reports the amount of the firm offer as the amount applied for, unless the applicant requests a different amount. If the firm offer does not specify an amount or limit and the applicant does not request a specific amount, the amount applied for is the amount underwritten by the financial institution. If the firm offer specifies an amount or limit as a range and the applicant does not request a specific amount, the amount applied for is the amount underwritten by the financial institution. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-7-Interp-4" id="107-a-7-Interp-4"><strong>4. Additional amounts on an existing account.</strong> When reporting a covered application that seeks additional credit amounts on an existing account, the financial institution reports only the additional credit amount sought, and not any previous amounts extended. See comment 103(b)-3.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-7-Interp-5" id="107-a-7-Interp-5"><strong>5. Initial amount otherwise undetermined.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(c), a financial institution shall maintain procedures reasonably designed to collect applicant-provided data, which includes the credit amount initially requested by the applicant (other than for products that do not involve a specific amount requested). However, if a financial institution is nonetheless unable to collect or otherwise determine the amount initially requested, the financial institution reports that the amount applied for is “not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined.” But see comment 107(a)(7)-2 for how to report the credit amount initially requested by the applicant for particular types of credit products that do not involve a specific amount requested. </p>

<h3>107(a)(8) Amount Approved or Originated</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-8-Interp-1" id="107-a-8-Interp-1"><strong>1. General.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(8) by reporting the amount approved or originated for credit that is originated or approved but not accepted. For applications that the financial institution, pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(9), reports as denied, withdrawn by the applicant, or incomplete, the financial institution reports that the amount approved or originated is “not applicable.” </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-8-Interp-2" id="107-a-8-Interp-2"><strong>2. Multiple approval amounts.</strong> A financial institution may sometimes approve an applicant for more than one credit amount, allowing the applicant to choose which amount the applicant prefers for the extension or line of credit. When multiple approval amounts are offered for a closed-end credit transaction for which the action taken is approved but not accepted, and the applicant does not accept the approved offer of credit in any amount, the financial institution reports the highest amount approved. If the applicant accepts the offer of closed-end credit, the financial institution reports the amount originated. When multiple approval amounts are offered for an open-end credit transaction for which the action taken is approved but not accepted, and the applicant does not accept the approved offer of credit in any amount, the financial institution reports the highest amount approved. If the applicant accepts the offer of open-end credit, the financial institution reports the actual credit limit established.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-8-Interp-3" id="107-a-8-Interp-3"><strong>3. Amount approved or originated—closed-end credit transaction.</strong> For an originated closed-end credit transaction, the financial institution reports the principal amount to be repaid. This amount will generally be disclosed on the legal obligation. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-8-Interp-4" id="107-a-8-Interp-4"><strong>4. Amount approved or originated—refinancing.</strong> For a refinancing, the financial institution reports the amount of credit approved or originated under the terms of the new debt obligation.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-8-Interp-5" id="107-a-8-Interp-5"><strong>5. Amount approved or originated—counteroffer.</strong> If an applicant agrees to proceed with consideration of a counteroffer for an amount or limit different from the amount for which the applicant applied, and the covered credit transaction is approved and originated, the financial institution reports the amount granted. If an applicant does not agree to proceed with consideration of a counteroffer or fails to respond, the institution reports the application as denied and reports “not applicable” for the amount approved or originated. See comment 107(a)(9)-2.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-8-Interp-6" id="107-a-8-Interp-6"><strong>6. Amount approved or originated—existing accounts.</strong> For additional credit amounts that were approved for or originated on an existing account, the financial institution reports only the additional credit amount approved or originated, and not any previous amounts extended.</p>

<h3>107(a)(9) Action Taken</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-1" id="107-a-9-Interp-1"><strong>1. General.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(9) by selecting the action taken by the financial institution on the application from the following list: originated, approved but not accepted, denied, withdrawn by the applicant, or incomplete. A financial institution identifies the applicable action taken code based on final action taken on the covered application.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-1-i" id="107-a-9-Interp-1-i"><strong>i. Originated.</strong> A financial institution reports that the application was originated if the financial institution made a credit decision approving the application and that credit decision resulted in an extension of credit.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-1-ii" id="107-a-9-Interp-1-ii"><strong>ii. Approved but not accepted.</strong> A financial institution reports that the application was approved but not accepted if the financial institution made a credit decision approving the application, but the applicant or the party that initially received the application failed to respond to the financial institution’s approval within the specified time, or the covered credit transaction was not otherwise consummated or the account was not otherwise opened. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-1-iii" id="107-a-9-Interp-1-iii"><strong>iii. Denied.</strong> A financial institution reports that the application was denied if it made a credit decision denying the application before an applicant withdrew the application, before the application was closed for incompleteness, or before the application was denied on the basis of incompleteness.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-1-iv" id="107-a-9-Interp-1-iv"><strong>iv. Withdrawn by the applicant.</strong> A financial institution reports that the application was withdrawn if the application was expressly withdrawn by the applicant before the financial institution made a credit decision approving or denying the application, before the application was closed for incompleteness, or before the application was denied on the basis of incompleteness. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-1-v" id="107-a-9-Interp-1-v"><strong>v. Incomplete.</strong> A financial institution reports that the application was incomplete if the financial institution took adverse action on the basis of incompleteness under §&#160;1002.9(a)(1)(ii) and (c)(1)(i) or provided a written notice of incompleteness under §&#160;1002.9(c)(1)(ii) and (2), and the applicant did not respond to the request for additional information within the period of time specified in the notice.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-2" id="107-a-9-Interp-2"><strong>2. Treatment of counteroffers.</strong> If a financial institution makes a counteroffer to grant credit on terms other than those originally requested by the applicant (for example, for a shorter loan maturity, with a different interest rate, or in a different amount) and the applicant declines the counteroffer or fails to respond, the institution reports the action taken as a denial on the original terms requested by the applicant. If the applicant agrees to proceed with consideration of the financial institution’s counteroffer, the financial institution reports the action taken as the disposition of the application based on the terms of the counteroffer. For example, assume an applicant applies for a term loan and the financial institution makes a counteroffer to proceed with consideration of a line of credit. If the applicant declines to be considered for a line of credit, the financial institution reports the application as a denied request for a term loan. If, on the other hand, the applicant agrees to be considered for a line of credit, then the financial institution reports the action taken as the disposition of the application for the line of credit. For instance, using the same example, if the financial institution makes a credit decision approving the line of credit, but the applicant fails to respond to the financial institution’s approval within the specified time by accepting the credit offer, the financial institution reports the application on the line of credit as approved but not accepted.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-3" id="107-a-9-Interp-3"><strong>3. Treatment of rescinded transactions.</strong> If a borrower successfully rescinds a transaction after closing but before a financial institution is required to submit its small business lending application register containing the information for the application under §&#160;1002.109, the institution reports the application as approved but not accepted.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-4" id="107-a-9-Interp-4"><strong>4. Treatment of pending applications.</strong> A financial institution does not report any application still pending at the end of the calendar year; it reports such applications on its small business lending application register for the year in which final action is taken.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-5" id="107-a-9-Interp-5"><strong>5. Treatment of conditional approvals.</strong> If a financial institution issues an approval that is subject to the applicant meeting certain conditions prior to closing, the financial institution reports the action taken as provided below dependent on whether the conditions are solely customary commitment or closing conditions or if the conditions include any underwriting or creditworthiness conditions. Customary commitment or closing conditions may include, for example, a clear-title requirement, proof of insurance policies, or a subordination agreement from another lienholder. Underwriting or creditworthiness conditions may include, for example, conditions that constitute a counteroffer (such as a demand for a higher down-payment), satisfactory loan-to-value ratios, or verification or confirmation, in whatever form the institution requires, that the applicant meets underwriting conditions concerning applicant creditworthiness, including documentation or verification of revenue, income or assets.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-5-i" id="107-a-9-Interp-5-i"><strong>i. Conditional approval—denial.</strong> If the approval is conditioned on satisfying underwriting or creditworthiness conditions, those conditions are not met, and the financial institution takes adverse action on some basis other than incompleteness, the financial institution reports the action taken as denied.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-5-ii" id="107-a-9-Interp-5-ii"><strong>ii. Conditional approval—incompleteness.</strong> If the approval is conditioned on satisfying underwriting or creditworthiness conditions that the financial institution needs to make the credit decision, and the financial institution takes adverse action on the basis of incompleteness under §&#160;1002.9(a)(1)(ii) and (c)(1)(i), or has sent a written notice of incompleteness under §&#160;1002.9(c)(1)(ii) and (2), and the applicant did not respond within the period of time specified in the notice, the financial institution reports the action taken as incomplete. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-5-iii" id="107-a-9-Interp-5-iii"><strong>iii. Conditional approval—approved but not accepted.</strong> If the approval is conditioned on satisfying conditions that are solely customary commitment or closing conditions and the conditions are not met, the financial institution reports the action taken as approved but not accepted. If all the conditions (underwriting, creditworthiness, or customary commitment or closing conditions) are satisfied and the financial institution agrees to extend credit but the covered credit transaction is not originated (for example, because the applicant withdraws), the financial institution reports the action taken as approved but not accepted.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-9-Interp-5-iv" id="107-a-9-Interp-5-iv"><strong>iv. Conditional approval—withdrawn by the applicant.</strong> If the applicant expressly withdraws before satisfying all underwriting or creditworthiness conditions and before the institution denies the application or before the institution closes the file for incompleteness, the financial institution reports the action taken as withdrawn.</p>

<h3>107(a)(10) Action Taken Date</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-10-Interp-1" id="107-a-10-Interp-1"><strong>1. Reporting action taken date for denied applications.</strong> For applications that are denied, a financial institution reports either the date the application was denied or the date the denial notice was sent to the applicant.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-10-Interp-2" id="107-a-10-Interp-2"><strong>2. Reporting action taken date for applications withdrawn by applicant.</strong> For applications that are withdrawn by the applicant, the financial institution reports the date the express withdrawal was received, or the date shown on the notification form in the case of a written withdrawal.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-10-Interp-3" id="107-a-10-Interp-3"><strong>3. Reporting action taken date for applications that are approved but not accepted.</strong> For applications approved by a financial institution but not accepted by the applicant, the financial institution reports any reasonable date, such as the approval date, the deadline for accepting the offer, or the date the file was closed. A financial institution should generally be consistent in its approach to reporting by, for example, establishing procedures for how to report this date for particular scenarios, products, or divisions.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-10-Interp-4" id="107-a-10-Interp-4"><strong>4. Reporting action taken date for originated applications.</strong> For applications that result in an extension of credit, a financial institution generally reports the closing or account opening date. If the disbursement of funds takes place on a date later than the closing or account opening date, the institution may, alternatively, use the date of initial disbursement. A financial institution should generally be consistent in its approach to reporting by, for example, establishing procedures for how to report this date for particular scenarios, products, or divisions.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-10-Interp-5" id="107-a-10-Interp-5"><strong>5. Reporting action taken date for incomplete applications.</strong> For applications closed for incompleteness or denied for incompleteness, the financial institution reports either the date the action was taken or the date the denial or incompleteness notice was sent to the applicant.</p>

<h3>107(a)(11) Denial Reasons</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-11-Interp-1" id="107-a-11-Interp-1"><strong>1. Reason for denial—in general.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(11) by reporting the principal reason or reasons it denied the application, indicating up to four reasons. The financial institution reports only the principal reason or reasons it denied the application. For example, if a financial institution denies an application due to insufficient cashflow, unacceptable collateral, and unverifiable business information, the financial institution is required to report these three reasons. The reasons reported must accurately describe the principal reason or reasons the financial institution denied the application. A financial institution reports denial reasons by selecting its principal reason or reasons for denying the application from the following list:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-11-Interp-1-i" id="107-a-11-Interp-1-i"><strong>i. Credit characteristics of the business.</strong> A financial institution reports the denial reason as “credit characteristics of the business” if it denies the application based on an assessment of the business’s ability to meet its current or future credit obligations. Examples include business credit score, history of business bankruptcy or delinquency, and/or a high number of recent business credit inquiries.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-11-Interp-1-ii" id="107-a-11-Interp-1-ii"><strong>ii. Credit characteristics of the principal owner(s) or guarantor(s).</strong> A financial institution reports the denial reason as “credit characteristics of the principal owner(s) or guarantor(s)” if it denies the application based on an assessment of the principal owner(s) or guarantor(s)’s ability to meet its current or future credit obligations. Examples include principal owner(s) or guarantor(s)’s credit score, history of charge offs, bankruptcy or delinquency, low net worth, limited or insufficient credit history, or history of excessive overdraft.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-11-Interp-1-iii" id="107-a-11-Interp-1-iii"><strong>iii. Use of credit proceeds.</strong> A financial institution reports the denial reason as “use of credit proceeds” if it denies an application because, as a matter of policy or practice, it places limits on lending to certain kinds of businesses, products, or activities it has identified as high risk. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-11-Interp-1-iv" id="107-a-11-Interp-1-iv"><strong>iv. Cashflow.</strong> A financial institution reports the denial reason as “cashflow” when it denies an application due to insufficient or inconsistent cashflow.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-11-Interp-1-v" id="107-a-11-Interp-1-v"><strong>v. Collateral.</strong> A financial institution reports the denial reason as “collateral” when it denies an application due to collateral that it deems insufficient or otherwise unacceptable. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-11-Interp-1-vi" id="107-a-11-Interp-1-vi"><strong>vi. Time in business.</strong> A financial institution reports the denial reason as “time in business” when it denies an application due to insufficient time or experience in a line of business. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-11-Interp-1-vii" id="107-a-11-Interp-1-vii"><strong>vii. Government loan program criteria.</strong> Certain loan programs are backed by government agencies that have specific eligibility requirements. When those requirements are not met by an applicant, and the financial institution denies the application, the financial institution reports the denial reason as “government loan program criteria.” For example, if an applicant cannot meet a government-guaranteed loan program’s requirement to provide a guarantor or proof of insurance, the financial institution reports the reason for the denial as “government loan program criteria.” </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-11-Interp-1-viii" id="107-a-11-Interp-1-viii"><strong>viii. Aggregate exposure.</strong> Aggregate exposure is a measure of the total exposure or level of indebtedness of the business and its principal owner(s) associated with an application. A financial institution reports the denial reason as “aggregate exposure” where the total debt associated with the application is deemed high or exceeds certain debt thresholds set by the financial institution. For example, if an application for unsecured credit exceeds the maximum amount a financial institution is permitted to approve per applicant, as stated in its credit guidelines, and the financial institution denies the application for this reason, the financial institution reports the reason for denial as “aggregate exposure.” </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-11-Interp-1-ix" id="107-a-11-Interp-1-ix"><strong>ix. Unverifiable information.</strong> A financial institution reports the denial reason as “unverifiable information” when it is unable to verify information provided as part of the application, and denies the application for that reason. The unverifiable information must be necessary for the financial institution to make a credit decision based on its procedures for the type of credit requested. Examples include unverifiable assets or collateral, unavailable business credit report, and unverifiable business ownership composition.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-11-Interp-1-x" id="107-a-11-Interp-1-x"><strong>x. Other.</strong> A financial institution reports the denial reason as “other” where none of the enumerated denial reasons adequately describe the principal reason or reasons it denied the application, and the institution reports the denial reason or reasons via free-form text field. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-11-Interp-2" id="107-a-11-Interp-2"><strong>2. Reason for denial—not applicable.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(11) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable if the action taken on the application, pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(9), is not a denial. For example, if the application resulted in an originated covered credit transaction, or the application was approved but not accepted, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(11) by reporting not applicable.</p>

<h3>107(a)(12)(i) Interest Rate</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-12-i-Interp-1" id="107-a-12-i-Interp-1"><strong>1. General.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(i) by reporting the interest rate applicable to the amount of credit approved or originated as reported pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(8).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-12-i-Interp-2" id="107-a-12-i-Interp-2"><strong>2. Interest rate—initial period.</strong> If a covered credit transaction includes an initial period with an introductory interest rate of 12 months or less, after which the interest rate adjusts upwards or shifts from a fixed to variable rate, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(i) by reporting information about the interest rate applicable after the initial period. If a covered transaction includes an initial period with an interest rate of more than 12 months after which the interest rate resets, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(i) by reporting information about the interest rate applicable prior to the reset period. For example, if a financial institution originates a covered credit transaction with a fixed, initial interest rate of 0 percent for six months following origination, after which the interest rate will adjust according to a Prime index rate plus a 3 percent margin, the financial institution reports the 3 percent margin, Prime as the name of the index used to adjust the interest rate, the number 6 for the length of the initial period, and “not applicable” for the index value. As another example, in a 10/1 adjustable-rate mortgage transaction, where the first 10 years of the repayment period has a fixed rate of 3 percent and after year 10 the interest rate will adjust according to a Prime index rate plus a 3 percent margin, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(i) by reporting the fixed rate of 3 percent, the number 120 for the initial period, and “not applicable” in the fields for the index, margin, and index value.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-12-i-Interp-3" id="107-a-12-i-Interp-3"><strong>3. Multiple interest rates.</strong> If a covered credit transaction includes multiple interest rates applicable to different credit features, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(i) by reporting the interest rate applicable to the amount of credit approved or originated reported pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(8). For example, if a financial institution originates a credit card with different interest rates for purchases, balance transfers, cash advances, and overdraft advances, the financial institution reports the interest rate applicable for purchases.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-12-i-Interp-4" id="107-a-12-i-Interp-4"><strong>4. Index names.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(i) by selecting the index used from the following list: Wall Street Journal Prime, 6-month CD rate, 1-year T-Bill, 3-year T-Bill, 5-year T-Note, 12-month average of 10-year T-Bill, Cost of Funds Index (COFI)-National, Cost of Funds Index (COFI)-11th District, Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT). If the index used is internal to the financial institution, the financial institution reports “internal index” via the list of indices provided. If the index used does not appear on the list of indices provided (and is not internal to the financial institution), the financial institution reports “other” and reports the name of the index via free-form text field.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-12-i-Interp-5" id="107-a-12-i-Interp-5"><strong>5. Index value.</strong> For covered transactions with an adjustable interest rate, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(i)(B) by reporting the index value used to set the rate that is or would be applicable to the covered transaction.</p>

Charges in comparable cash transactions.</strong> Charges imposed uniformly in cash and credit transactions are not reportable under §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(ii). In determining whether an item is part of the total origination charges, a financial institution should compare the covered credit transaction in question with a similar cash transaction. A financial institution financing the sale of property or services may compare charges with those payable in a similar cash transaction by the seller of the property or service.</p>

Net lender credit.</strong> If a financial institution provides a credit to an applicant that is greater than the total origination charges the applicant would have paid, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(ii) by reporting the net lender credit as a negative amount. For example, if a covered transaction has $500 provided to the applicant at origination to offset closing costs, and the financial institution does not charge any origination charges, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(ii) by reporting negative $500 as the total origination charges.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-12-iii-Interp-1" id="107-a-12-iii-Interp-1"><strong>1. Amount.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(iii) by including the fees reported in §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(ii) that are fees paid by the applicant directly to the broker or to the financial institution for delivery to the broker. For example, a covered transaction has $3,000 of total origination charges. Of that $3,000, $250 are fees paid by the applicant directly to a broker and an additional $300 are fees paid to the financial institution for delivery to the broker. The financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(iii) by reporting $550 in the broker fees reported.</p>

Fees paid directly to a broker by an applicant.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(iii) by relying on the best information readily available to the financial institution at the time final action is taken. Information readily available could include, for example, information provided by an applicant or broker that the financial institution reasonably believes regarding the amount of fees paid by the applicant directly to the broker. </p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-12-iv-Interp-1" id="107-a-12-iv-Interp-1"><strong>1. Charges during the initial annual period.</strong> The total initial annual charges include all charges scheduled to be imposed during the initial annual period following origination. For example, if a financial institution originates a covered credit transaction with a $50 monthly fee and a $100 annual fee, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(iv) by reporting $700 in the initial annual charges reported. If there will be a charge in the initial annual period following origination but the amount of that charge is uncertain at the time of origination, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(iv) by not reporting that charge as scheduled to be imposed during the initial annual period following origination. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-12-iv-Interp-2" id="107-a-12-iv-Interp-2"><strong>2. Interest excluded.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(iv) by excluding any interest expense from the initial annual charges reported.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-12-iv-Interp-3" id="107-a-12-iv-Interp-3"><strong>3. Avoidable charges.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(iv) by only including scheduled charges and excluding any charges for events that are avoidable by the applicant from the initial annual charges reported. Examples of avoidable charges include charges for late payment, for exceeding a credit limit, for delinquency or default, or for paying items that overdraw an account.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-12-iv-Interp-4" id="107-a-12-iv-Interp-4"><strong>4. Initial annual charges—examples.</strong> Examples of charges scheduled to be imposed during the initial annual period may include monthly fees, annual fees, and other similar charges.</p>

Scheduled charges with variable amounts.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(iv) by reporting as the default the highest amount for a charge scheduled to be imposed. For example, if a covered credit transaction has a $75 monthly fee, but the fee is reduced to $0 if the applicant maintains an account at the financial institution originating the covered credit transaction, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(iv) by reporting $900 ($75 x 12) in the initial annual charges reported. </p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-12-vi-Interp-1" id="107-a-12-vi-Interp-1"><strong>1. Policies and procedures applicable to the covered credit transaction.</strong> The policies and procedures applicable to the covered credit transaction include the practices that the financial institution follows when evaluating applications for the specific credit type and credit purpose requested. For example, assume that a financial institution’s written procedures permit it to include prepayment penalties in the loan agreement for its term loans secured by non-owner occupied commercial real estate. For such transactions, the financial institution includes prepayment penalties in some loan agreements but not others. For an application for, or origination of, a term loan secured by non-owner occupied commercial real estate, the financial institution reports under §&#160;1002.107(a)(12)(vi)(A) that a prepayment penalty could have been included under the policies and procedures applicable to the transaction, regardless of whether the term loan secured by non-owner occupied commercial real estate actually includes a prepayment penalty.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-12-vi-Interp-2" id="107-a-12-vi-Interp-2"><strong>2.

For example, under the terms of a transaction, the amount of funds advanced is $12,000, the amount to be repaid is $24,000 (which includes $12,000 in principal and $12,000 in interest and fees), the length of the transaction is 12 months, and the applicant must repay $2,000 per month. The terms of the transaction state that if the applicant prepays the principal before the 12-month period is over, the applicant is responsible for paying the difference between $24,000 and the amount the applicant has already repaid prior to initiating prepayment. The difference between the $24,000 to be repaid and what the applicant has already repaid prior to initiating prepayment is a balloon finance charge and should be reported as a prepayment penalty.</p>

General.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(13) by reporting a census tract number as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, which includes State and county numerical codes. A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(13) if it uses the boundaries and codes in effect on January 1 of the calendar year covered by the small business lending application register that it is reporting. The financial institution reports census tract based on the following:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-13-Interp-1-i" id="107-a-13-Interp-1-i"><strong>i. Proceeds address.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(a)(13) by reporting a census tract based on the address or location where the proceeds of the credit applied for or originated will be or would have been principally applied, if known. For example, a financial institution would report a census tract based on the address or location of the site where the proceeds of a construction loan will be applied. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-13-Interp-1-ii" id="107-a-13-Interp-1-ii"><strong>ii.

A financial institution may rely on the applicant’s statements or on information provided by the applicant in collecting and reporting gross annual revenue, even if the applicant’s statement or information is based on estimation or extrapolation. However, pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(b), if the financial institution verifies the gross annual revenue provided by the applicant, it must report the verified information. Also, pursuant to comment 107(c)(1)-5, a financial institution reports updated gross annual revenue data if it obtains more current data from the applicant during the application process. If a financial institution has already verified gross annual revenue data and then the applicant updates it, the financial institution reports the information it believes to be more accurate, in its discretion. The financial institution may use the following language to ask about gross annual revenue and may rely on the applicant’s answer (unless subsequently verified or updated):</p>

For example, if the financial institution collects the number of years the applicant has existed (such as by asking the applicant when its business was started, or by obtaining the applicant’s date of incorporation from a Secretary of State or other State or Federal agency that registers or licenses businesses) as the time in business, the financial institution reports that information accordingly pursuant to comment 107(a)(17)-1.i.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-18-Interp-1" id="107-a-18-Interp-1"><strong>1. General.</strong> A financial institution must ask an applicant whether it is a minority-owned, women-owned, and/or LGBTQI+-owned business. The financial institution must permit an applicant to refuse (<em>i.e.</em>, decline) to answer the financial institution’s inquiry regarding business status and must inform the applicant that the applicant is not required to provide the information. See the sample data collection form in appendix E to this part for sample language for providing this notice to applicants. The financial institution must report the applicant’s substantive response regarding each business status, that the applicant declined to answer the inquiry (that is, selected an answer option of “I do not wish to provide this information” or similar), or its failure to respond to the inquiry (that is, “not provided by applicant”), as applicable. </p>

A financial institution must also inform the applicant that Federal law requires it to ask for an applicant’s minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQI+-owned business statuses to help ensure that all small business applicants for credit are treated fairly and that communities’ small business credit needs are being fulfilled. A financial institution may combine these notices regarding minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQI+-owned business statuses with the notices that a financial institution is required to provide when requesting principal owners’ ethnicity, race, and sex if a financial institution requests information pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(18) and (19) in the same data collection form or at the same time.

See §&#160;1002.111(b) and comment 111(b)-1.

See the sample data collection form in appendix E. For example, if the financial institution sends the data collection form via email, the data collection form should be a separate attachment to the email or accessed through a separate link in the email. If the financial institution uses a web-based data collection form, the form should be on its own page.</p>

For example, if a financial institution uses a paper data collection form to ask an applicant if it is a minority-owned business, a women-owned business, and/or an LGBTQI+-owned business and the applicant does not indicate that it is a minority-owned business, the financial institution must not report that the applicant is a minority-owned business, even if the applicant indicates that it is a minority-owned business for other purposes, such as for a special purpose credit program or a Small Business Administration program.</p>

If an applicant indicates that a principal owner is Other Hispanic or Latino, the financial institution must permit the applicant to provide additional information regarding the principal owner’s ethnicity, by using free-form text on a paper or electronic data collection form or using language that informs the applicant of the opportunity to self-identify when taking the application by means other than a paper or electronic data collection form, such as by telephone. The financial institution must permit the applicant to provide additional information indicating, for example, that the principal owner is Argentinean, Colombian, Dominican, Nicaraguan, Salvadoran, or Spaniard.

If an applicant chooses to provide additional information regarding a principal owner’s ethnicity, such as by indicating that a principal owner is Argentinean orally or in writing on a paper or electronic form, a financial institution must report that additional information via free-form text. If the applicant provides such additional information but does not also indicate that the principal owner is Other Hispanic or Latino (<em>e.g.</em>, by selecting Other Hispanic or Latino on a paper or electronic form), a financial institution is permitted, but not required, to report Other Hispanic or Latino as well.</p>

Selecting multiple categories.</strong> The financial institution must permit the applicant to select one, both, or none of the aggregate categories and as many disaggregated subcategories as the applicant chooses. A financial institution must permit an applicant to select a disaggregated subcategory even if the applicant does not select the corresponding aggregate category. For example, an applicant must be permitted to select the Mexican disaggregated subcategory for a principal owner without being required to select the Hispanic or Latino aggregate category. If an applicant provides ethnicity information for a principal owner, the financial institution reports all of the aggregate categories and disaggregated subcategories provided by the applicant. For example, if an applicant selects both aggregate categories and four disaggregated subcategories for a principal owner, the financial institution reports the two aggregate categories that the applicant selected and all four of the disaggregated subcategories that the applicant selected. Additionally, if an applicant selects only the Mexican disaggregated subcategory for a principal owner and no aggregate categories, the financial institution reports Mexican for the ethnicity of the applicant’s principal owner but does not also report Hispanic or Latino. Further, if the applicant selects an aggregate category (<em>e.g.</em>, Not Hispanic or Latino) and a disaggregated subcategory that does not correspond to the aggregate category (<em>e.g.</em>, Puerto Rican), the financial institution reports the information as provided by the applicant (<em>e.g.</em>, Not Hispanic or Latino, and Puerto Rican).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="107-a-19-Interp-14-ii-A" id="107-a-19-Interp-14-ii-A"><strong>A.</strong> The Asian aggregate category includes the following disaggregated subcategories: Asian Indian; Chinese; Filipino; Japanese; Korean; Vietnamese; and Other Asian. An applicant must also be permitted to provide the principal owner’s race using one or more of these disaggregated subcategories regardless of whether the applicant indicates that the principal owner is Asian and regardless of whether the applicant selects any aggregate categories. Additionally, if an applicant indicates that a principal owner is Other Asian, the financial institution must permit the applicant to provide additional information about the principal owner’s race, by using free-form text on a paper or electronic data collection form or using language that informs the applicant of the opportunity to self-identify when taking the application by means other than a paper or electronic data collection form, such as by telephone. The financial institution must permit the applicant to provide additional information indicating, for example, that the principal owner is Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, Pakistani, or Thai.

<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="107-a-19-Interp-14-ii-B" id="107-a-19-Interp-14-ii-B"><strong>B.</strong> The Black or African American aggregate category includes the following disaggregated subcategories: African American; Ethiopian; Haitian; Jamaican; Nigerian; Somali; or Other Black or African American. An applicant must also be permitted to provide the principal owner’s race using one or more of these disaggregated subcategories regardless of whether the applicant indicates that the principal owner is Black or African American and regardless of whether the applicant selects any aggregate categories. Additionally, if an applicant indicates that a principal owner is Other Black or African American, the financial institution must permit the applicant to provide additional information about the principal owner’s race, by using free-form text on a paper or electronic data collection form or using language that informs the applicant of the opportunity to self-identify when taking the application by means other than a paper or electronic data collection form, such as by telephone. The financial institution must permit the applicant to provide additional information indicating, for example, that the principal owner is Barbadian, Ghanaian, or South African. See the sample data collection form in appendix E for sample language.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="107-a-19-Interp-14-ii-C" id="107-a-19-Interp-14-ii-C"><strong>C.</strong> The Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander aggregate category includes the following disaggregated subcategories: Guamanian or Chamorro; Native Hawaiian; Samoan; and Other Pacific Islander. An applicant must also be permitted to provide the principal owner’s race using one or more of these disaggregated subcategories regardless of whether the applicant indicates that the principal owner is Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander and regardless of whether the applicant selects any aggregate categories. Additionally, if an applicant indicates that a principal owner is Other Pacific Islander, the financial institution must permit the applicant to provide additional information about the principal owner’s race, by using free-form text on a paper or electronic data collection form or using language that informs the applicant of the opportunity to self-identify when taking the application by means other than a paper or electronic data collection form, such as by telephone. The financial institution must permit the applicant to provide additional information indicating, for example, that the principal owner is Fijian or Tongan.

<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="107-a-19-Interp-14-ii-D" id="107-a-19-Interp-14-ii-D"><strong>D.</strong> If an applicant chooses to provide additional information regarding a principal owner’s race, such as indicating that a principal owner is Cambodian, Barbadian, or Fijian orally or in writing on a paper or electronic form, a financial institution must report that additional information via free-form text in the appropriate data reporting field. If the applicant provides such additional information but does not also indicate that the principal owner is Other Asian, Other Black or African American, or Other Pacific Islander, as applicable (<em>e.g.</em>, by selecting Other Asian on a paper or electronic form), a financial institution is permitted, but not required, to report the corresponding “Other” race disaggregated subcategory (<em>i.e.</em>, Other Asian, Other Black or African American, or Other Pacific Islander). </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="107-a-19-Interp-14-ii-E" id="107-a-19-Interp-14-ii-E"><strong>E.</strong> In addition to permitting an applicant to indicate that a principal owner is American Indian or Alaska Native, a financial institution must permit an applicant to provide the name of an enrolled or principal tribe, by using free-form text on a paper or electronic data collection form or using language that informs the applicant of the opportunity to self-identify when taking the application by means other than a paper or electronic data collection form, such as by telephone. If an applicant chooses to provide the name of an enrolled or principal tribe, a financial institution must report that information via free-form text in the appropriate data reporting field. If the applicant provides the name of an enrolled or principal tribe but does not also indicate that the principal owner is American Indian or Alaska Native (<em>e.g.</em>, by selecting American Indian or Alaska Native on a paper or electronic form), a financial institution is permitted, but not required, to report American Indian or Alaska Native as well.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-19-Interp-14-iii" id="107-a-19-Interp-14-iii"><strong>iii. Selecting multiple categories.</strong> The financial institution must permit the applicant to select as many aggregate categories and disaggregated subcategories as the applicant chooses. A financial institution must permit an applicant to select one or more disaggregated subcategories even if the applicant does not select an aggregate category. For example, an applicant must be permitted to select the Chinese disaggregated subcategory for a principal owner without being required to select the Asian aggregate category. If an applicant provides race information for a principal owner, the financial institution reports all of the aggregate categories and disaggregated subcategories provided by the applicant. For example, if an applicant selects two aggregate categories and five disaggregated subcategories for a principal owner, the financial institution reports the two aggregate categories that the applicant selected and the five disaggregated subcategories that the applicant selected. Additionally, if an applicant selects only the Chinese disaggregated subcategory for a principal owner, the financial institution reports Chinese for the race of the principal owner but does not also report that the principal owner is Asian. Similarly, if the applicant selects an aggregate category (e.g., Asian) and a disaggregated subcategory that does not correspond to the aggregate category (e.g., Native Hawaiian), the financial institution reports the information as provided by the applicant (e.g., Asian and Native Hawaiian).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-19-Interp-15" id="107-a-19-Interp-15"><strong>15. Sex.</strong> Generally, a financial institution must permit an applicant to provide each principal owner’s sex for purposes of §&#160;1002.107(a)(19). When requesting information about a principal owner’s sex, a financial institution shall use the term “sex/gender.” If the financial institution uses a paper or electronic data collection form to collect the information, the financial institution must allow the applicant to provide each principal owner’s sex/gender using free-form text. When a financial institution collects the information orally, such as by telephone, the financial institution must inform the applicant of the opportunity to provide each principal owner’s sex/gender and record the applicant’s response. A financial institution reports the substantive information provided by the applicant (reported via free-form text in the appropriate data reporting field), or reports that the applicant declined to provide the information.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-19-Interp-16" id="107-a-19-Interp-16"><strong>16. Ethnicity and race information requested orally.</strong> As described in comments 107(a)(19)-13 and -14, when collecting principal owners’ ethnicity and race pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(19), a financial institution must present the applicant with the specified aggregate categories and disaggregated subcategories. When collecting ethnicity and race information orally, such as by telephone, a financial institution may not present the applicant with the option to decline to provide the information without also presenting the applicant with the specified aggregate categories and disaggregated subcategories. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-19-Interp-16-i" id="107-a-19-Interp-16-i"><strong>i. Ethnicity and race categories.</strong> Notwithstanding comments 107(a)(19)-13 and -14, a financial institution is not required to read aloud every disaggregated subcategory when collecting ethnicity and race information orally, such as by telephone. Rather, the financial institution must orally present the lists of aggregate ethnicity and race categories, followed by the disaggregated subcategories (if any) associated with the aggregate categories selected by the applicant or which the applicant requests to be presented. After the applicant makes any disaggregated category selections associated with the aggregate ethnicity or race category, the financial institution must also ask if the applicant wishes to hear the lists of disaggregated subcategories for any aggregate categories not selected by the applicant. The financial institution must record any aggregate categories selected by the applicant, as well as any disaggregated subcategories regardless of whether such subcategories were selected based on the disaggregated subcategories read by the financial institution or were otherwise provided by the applicant. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-a-19-Interp-16-ii" id="107-a-19-Interp-16-ii"><strong>ii. More than one principal owner.</strong>  If an applicant has more than one principal owner, the financial institution is permitted to ask about ethnicity and race in a manner that reduces repetition when collecting ethnicity and race information orally, such as by telephone. For example, if an applicant has two principal owners, the financial institution may ask for both principal owners’ ethnicity at the same time, rather than asking about ethnicity, race, and sex for the first principal owner followed by ethnicity, race, and sex for the second principal owner. </p>

General.</strong> If the financial institution asks the applicant to provide the number of its principal owners pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(20), a financial institution must provide the definition of principal owner set forth in §&#160;1002.102(o). The financial institution satisfies this requirement if it provides the definition of principal owner as set forth in the sample data collection form in appendix E.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-20-Interp-2" id="107-a-20-Interp-2"><strong>2. Number of principal owners provided by applicant; verification of number of principal owners.</strong> The financial institution may rely on statements or information provided by the applicant in collecting and reporting the number of the applicant’s principal owners. However, pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(b), if the financial institution verifies the number of principal owners provided by the applicant, it must report the verified information.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-a-20-Interp-3" id="107-a-20-Interp-3"><strong>3. Number of principal owners not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(c), a financial institution shall maintain procedures reasonably designed to collect applicant-provided data, which includes the number of principal owners of the applicant. However, if a financial institution is nonetheless unable to collect or otherwise determine the applicant’s number of principal owners, the financial institution reports that the number of principal owners is “not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined.”</p>

<h3>107(b) Reliance on and Verification of Applicant-Provided Data</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-b-Interp-1" id="107-b-Interp-1"><strong>1. Reliance on information provided by an applicant or appropriate third-party sources.</strong> A financial institution may rely on statements made by an applicant (whether made in writing or orally) or information provided by an applicant when compiling and reporting data pursuant to subpart B of this part for applicant-provided data; the financial institution is not required to verify those statements or that information. However, if the financial institution does verify applicant statements or information for its own business purposes, such as statements relating to gross annual revenue or time in business, the financial institution reports the verified information. Depending on the circumstances and the financial institution’s procedures, certain applicant-provided data can be collected from appropriate third-party sources without a specific request from the applicant, and such information may also be relied on. For example, gross annual revenue or NAICS code may be collected from tax return documents; a financial institution may also collect an applicant’s NAICS code using third-party sources such as business information products. Applicant-provided data are the data that are or could be provided by the applicant, including §&#160;1002.107(a)(5) through (7) and (13) through (20). See comment 107(c)(1)-3. In regard to restrictions on verification of minority-owned, women-owned, and LGBTQI+-owned business statuses, and principal owners’ ethnicity, race, and sex, see comments 107(a)(18)-9 and 107(a)(19)-9.</p>

<h3>107(c)(1) In General</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-c-1-Interp-1" id="107-c-1-Interp-1"><strong>1. Procedures.</strong> The term “procedures” refers to the actual practices followed by a financial institution as well as its stated procedures. For example, if a financial institution’s stated procedure is to collect applicant-provided data on or with a paper application form, but employees encourage applicants to skip the page that asks whether the applicant is a minority-owned business, a women-owned business, or an LGBTQI+-owned business under §&#160;1002.107(a)(18), the financial institution’s procedures are not reasonably designed to obtain a response.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-c-1-Interp-2" id="107-c-1-Interp-2"><strong>2. Latitude to design procedures.</strong> A financial institution has flexibility to establish procedures concerning the timing and manner in which it collects applicant-provided data that work best for its particular lending model and product offerings, provided those procedures are reasonably designed to collect the applicant-provided data in §&#160;1002.107(a), as required pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(c)(1), and where applicable comply with the minimum requirements set forth in §&#160;1002.107(c)(2).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-c-1-Interp-3" id="107-c-1-Interp-3"><strong>3. Applicant-provided data.</strong> Applicant-provided data are the data that are or could be provided by the applicant, including §&#160;1002.107(a)(5) (credit type), §&#160;1002.107(a)(6) (credit purpose), §&#160;1002.107(a)(7) (amount applied for), §&#160;1002.107(a)(13) (address or location for purposes of determining census tract), §&#160;1002.107(a)(14) (gross annual revenue), §&#160;1002.107(a)(15) (NAICS code, or information about the business such that the financial institution can determine the applicant’s NAICS code), §&#160;1002.107(a)(16) (number of workers), §&#160;1002.107(a)(17) (time in business), §&#160;1002.107(a)(18) (minority-owned business status, women-owned business status, and LGBTQI+-owned business status), §&#160;1002.107(a)(19) (ethnicity, race, and sex of the applicant’s principal owners), and §&#160;1002.107(a)(20) (number of principal owners). Applicant-provided data do not include data that are generated or supplied only by the financial institution, including §&#160;1002.107(a)(1) (unique identifier), §&#160;1002.107(a)(2) (application date), §&#160;1002.107(a)(3) (application method), §&#160;1002.107(a)(4) (application recipient), §&#160;1002.107(a)(8) (amount approved or originated), §&#160;1002.107(a)(9) (action taken), §&#160;1002.107(a)(10) (action taken date), §&#160;1002.107(a)(11) (denial reasons), §&#160;1002.107(a)(12) (pricing information), and §&#160;1002.107(a)(13) (census tract, based on address or location provided by the applicant).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-c-1-Interp-4" id="107-c-1-Interp-4"><strong>4. Collecting applicant-provided data without a direct request to the applicant.</strong> Depending on the circumstances and the financial institution’s procedures, certain applicant-provided data can be collected without a direct request to the applicant. For example, credit type may be collected based on the type of product chosen by the applicant. Similarly, a financial institution may rely on appropriate third-party sources to collect certain applicant-provided data. See §&#160;1002.107(b) concerning the use of third-party sources. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-c-1-Interp-5" id="107-c-1-Interp-5"><strong>5. Data updated by the applicant.</strong> A financial institution reports updated data if it obtains more current data from the applicant during the application process. For example, if an applicant states its gross annual revenue for the preceding fiscal year was $3 million, but then the applicant notifies the financial institution that its revenue in the preceding fiscal year was actually $3.2 million, the financial institution reports gross annual revenue of $3.2 million. For reporting verified applicant-provided data, see §&#160;1002.107(b) and comment 107(b)-1. If a financial institution has already verified data and then the applicant updates it, the financial institution reports the information it believes to be more accurate, in its discretion. If a financial institution receives updates from the applicant after the application process has closed (for example, after closing or account opening), the financial institution may, at its discretion, update the data at any time prior to reporting the covered application to the Bureau.</p>

<h3>107(c)(2) Applicant-Provided Data Collected Directly From the Applicant</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-c-2-Interp-1" id="107-c-2-Interp-1"><strong>1. In general.</strong> Whether a financial institution’s procedures are reasonably designed to collect applicant-provided data is a fact-based determination and may depend on the financial institution’s particular lending model, product offerings, and other circumstances; procedures that are reasonably designed to obtain a response may therefore require additional provisions beyond the minimum criteria set forth in §&#160;1002.107(c)(2). In general, reasonably designed procedures will seek to maximize collection of applicant-provided data and minimize missing or erroneous data. While the requirements of §&#160;1002.107(c)(2) do not apply to applicant-provided data that a financial institution obtains without a direct request to the applicant, as explained in comment 107(c)(1)-4, in such instances, a covered financial institution must still comply with §&#160;1002.107(c)(1).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-c-2-Interp-2" id="107-c-2-Interp-2"><strong>2. Specific components.</strong></p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-c-2-Interp-2-i" id="107-c-2-Interp-2-i"><strong>i. Timing of initial collection attempt.</strong> While a financial institution has some flexibility concerning when applicant-provided data is are collected, under no circumstances may the initial request for applicant-provided data occur simultaneous with or after notifying an applicant of final action taken on a covered application. Generally, the earlier in the application process the financial institution initially seeks to collect applicant-provided data, the more likely the timing of collection is reasonably designed to obtain a response.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-c-2-Interp-2-ii" id="107-c-2-Interp-2-ii"><strong>ii. The request for applicant-provided data is prominently displayed or presented.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(c)(2)(ii), a financial institution must ensure an applicant actually sees, hears, or is otherwise presented with the request for applicant-provided data. If an applicant is likely to overlook or miss a request for applicant-provided data, the financial institution does not have reasonably designed procedures. Similarly, a financial institution also does not have reasonably designed procedures if it obscures, prevents, or inhibits an applicant from accessing or reviewing a request for applicant-provided data. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-c-2-Interp-2-iii" id="107-c-2-Interp-2-iii"><strong>iii. The collection does not have the effect of discouraging an applicant from responding to a request for applicant-provided data.</strong></p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="107-c-2-Interp-2-iii-A" id="107-c-2-Interp-2-iii-A"><strong>A.</strong> A covered financial institution avoids discouraging a response by, for example, communicating to the applicant that the collection of applicant-provided data is worthy of the applicant’s attention or is as important as information collected in connection with the financial institution’s creditworthiness determination. In contrast, a covered financial institution that collects applicant-provided data in a time or manner that directly or indirectly discourages or obstructs an applicant from responding or providing a particular response violates §&#160;1002.107(c)(2)(iii). For example, a financial institution may not discourage a response to inquiries regarding the demographic data pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(18) and (19) by communicating to the applicant that the request is unimportant, encouraging the applicant to bypass the form altogether, or attempting to influence or alter the applicant’s preferred response.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="107-c-2-Interp-2-iii-B" id="107-c-2-Interp-2-iii-B"><strong>B.</strong> A covered financial institution also avoids discouraging a response by requiring an applicant to provide a response to one or more requests for applicant-provided data in order to proceed with a covered application, including, as applicable, a response of “I do not wish to provide this information” or similar. (As described in comments 107(a)(18)-1 and 107(a)(19)-1, a financial institution must permit an applicant to decline to provide the demographic data required by §&#160;1002.107(a)(18) and (19), which can be satisfied by providing a response option of “I do not wish to provide this information” or similar.) For example, in an electronic application, a financial institution may require the applicant to either make a substantive selection about a principal owner’s ethnicity, race, or sex, select an option of “I do not wish to provide this information” or similar, or indicate there are no principal owners before allowing the applicant to proceed to the next page of requested information.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-c-2-Interp-2-iv" id="107-c-2-Interp-2-iv"><strong>iv. The applicant can easily provide a response.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(c)(2)(iv), a financial institution must structure the request for information in a manner that makes it easy for the applicant to provide a response. For example, a financial institution requests applicant-provided data in the same format as other information required for the covered application, provides applicants multiple methods to provide or return applicant-provided data (for example, on a written form, through a web portal, or through other means), or provides the applicant some other type of straightforward and seamless method to provide a response. Conversely, a financial institution must avoid imposing unnecessary burden on an applicant to provide the information requested or requiring the applicant to take steps that are inconsistent with the rest of its application process. For example, a financial institution does not have reasonably designed procedures if it collects application information related to its own creditworthiness determination in electronic form, but mails a paper form to the applicant initially seeking the data required under §&#160;1002.107(a) that the financial institution does not otherwise need for its creditworthiness determination and requiring the applicant to mail it back. On the other hand, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1002.107(c)(2)(iv) if, at its discretion, it requests the applicant to respond to inquiries made pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(18) and (19) through a reasonable method intended to keep the applicant’s responses discrete and protected from view.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-c-2-Interp-2-v" id="107-c-2-Interp-2-v"><strong>v. Multiple requests for applicant-provided data.</strong> A financial institution is permitted, but not required, to make more than one attempt to obtain applicant-provided data if the applicant does not respond to an initial request. For example, if an applicant initially does not respond when asked early in the application process (before notifying the applicant of final action taken on the application, pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(c)(2)(i)) to inquiries made pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(18) and (19), a financial institution may request this information again, for example, during a subsequent in-person meeting with the applicant or after notifying the applicant of final action taken on the covered application.</p>

<h3>107(c)(3) Procedures To Monitor Compliance</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-c-3-Interp-1" id="107-c-3-Interp-1"><strong>1. Procedures to identify and respond to indicia of potential discouragement, including low response rates.</strong> Section 1002.107(c)(3) requires a covered financial institution to maintain procedures designed to identify and respond to indicia of potential discouragement, including low response rates for applicant-provided data. In general, these include monitoring for low response rates (<em>i.e.</em>, the percentage of covered applications for which the financial institution has obtained some type of response to requests for applicant-provided data, including, as applicable, an applicant response of “I do not wish to provide this information” or similar); monitoring for significant irregularities in any particular response that may indicate steering, improper interference, or other potential discouragement or obstruction of applicants’ preferred responses; monitoring response rates and responses by division, location, loan officer, or other factors to ensure that no discouragement or improper conduct is occurring in some parts of a financial institution, even if the financial institution maintains adequate response rates and responses overall; providing adequate training to loan officers and other persons involved in collecting applicant-provided data; promptly investigating any indicia of potential discouragement; and taking prompt remedial action if discouragement or other improper conduct is identified.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="107-c-4-Interp" id="107-c-4-Interp"></div>
<h3>107(c)(4) Low Response Rates</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-c-4-Interp-1" id="107-c-4-Interp-1"><strong>1. In general.</strong> A low response rate for applicant-provided data may indicate that the financial institution has engaged in discouragement or otherwise failed to maintain reasonably designed procedures. Response rate generally refers to whether the financial institution has obtained some type of response to requests for applicant-provided data (including, as applicable, an applicant response of “I do not wish to provide this information” or similar). A response rate may be measured, as appropriate, as compared to financial institutions of a similar size, type, and/or geographic reach, or other factors, as appropriate. Similarly, significant irregularities in a particular response (for example, very high rates of an applicant response of “I do not wish to provide this information” or similar) may also indicate that a financial institution does not have reasonably designed procedures, for example, because of steering, improper interference, or other potential discouragement or obstruction of applicants’ preferred responses. Response rates may be relevant across all applicant-provided data, though are particularly relevant for the collection of the demographic data pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(18) and (19) given the heightened sensitivity of these inquiries and the importance of those data to the purposes of subpart B.</p>

<h3>107(d) Previously Collected Data</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-d-Interp-1" id="107-d-Interp-1"><strong>1. In general.</strong> A financial institution may, for the purpose of reporting such data pursuant to §&#160;1002.109, reuse certain previously collected data if the requirements of §&#160;1002.107(d) are met. In that circumstance, a financial institution need not seek to collect the data anew in connection with a subsequent covered application to satisfy the requirements of this subpart. For example, if an applicant applies for and is granted a term loan, and then subsequently applies for a credit card in the same calendar year, the financial institution need not request again the data specified in §&#160;1002.107(d). Similarly, if an applicant applies for more than one covered credit transaction at one time, a financial institution need only ask once for the data specified in §&#160;1002.107(d). </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-d-Interp-2" id="107-d-Interp-2"><strong>2. Data that can be reused.</strong> Subject to the requirements of §&#160;1002.107(d), a financial institution may reuse the following data: §&#160;1002.107(a)(13) (address or location for purposes of determining census tract), §&#160;1002.107(a)(14) (gross annual revenue) (subject to comment 107(d)-7), §&#160;1002.107(a)(15) (NAICS code), §&#160;1002.107(a)(16) (number of workers), §&#160;1002.107(a)(17) (time in business) (subject to comment 107(d)-8), §&#160;1002.107(a)(18) (minority-owned business status, women-owned business status, and LGBTQI+-owned business status) (subject to comment 107(d)-9), §&#160;1002.107(a)(19) (ethnicity, race, and sex of applicant’s principal owners) (subject to comment 107(d)-9), and §&#160;1002.107(a)(20) (number of principal owners). A financial institution is not, however, permitted to reuse other data, such as §&#160;1002.107(a)(6) (credit purpose).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-d-Interp-3" id="107-d-Interp-3"><strong>3. Previously reported data without a substantive response.</strong> Data have not been “previously collected” within the meaning of §&#160;1002.107(d) if the applicant did not provide a substantive response to the financial institution’s request for that data and the financial institution was not otherwise able to obtain the requested data (for example, from the applicant’s credit report, or tax returns).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-d-Interp-4" id="107-d-Interp-4"><strong>4. Updated data.</strong> If, after the application process has closed on a prior covered application, a financial institution obtains updated information relevant to the data required to be collected and reported pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(a)(13) through (20), and the applicant subsequently submits a new covered application, the financial institution must use the updated information in connection with the new covered application (if the requirements of §&#160;1002.107(d) are otherwise met) or seek to collect the data again. For example, if a business notifies a financial institution of a change of address of its sole business location, and subsequently submits a covered application within the time period specified in §&#160;1002.107(d)(1) for reusing previously collected data, the financial institution must report census tract based on the updated information. In that circumstance, the financial institution may still reuse other previously collected data to satisfy §&#160;1002.107(a)(14) through (20) if the requirements of §&#160;1002.107(d) are met.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-d-Interp-5" id="107-d-Interp-5"><strong>5. Collection within the preceding 36 months.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(d)(1), data can be reused to satisfy §&#160;1002.107(a)(13) and (15) through (20) if they are collected within the preceding 36 months. A financial institution may measure the 36-month period from the date of final action taken (§&#160;1002.107(a)(9)) on a prior application to the application date (§&#160;1002.107(a)(2)) on a subsequent application. For example, if a financial institution takes final action on an application on February 1, 2025, it may reuse certain previously collected data pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(d)(1) for subsequent covered applications dated or received by the financial institution through January 31, 2028.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-d-Interp-6" id="107-d-Interp-6"><strong>6. Reason to believe data are inaccurate.</strong> Whether a financial institution has reason to believe data are inaccurate pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(d)(2) depends on the particular facts and circumstances. For example, a financial institution may have reason to believe data on the applicant’s minority-owned business status, women-owned business status, and LGBTQI+-owned business status may be inaccurate if it knows that the applicant has had a change in ownership or a change in an owner’s percentage of ownership.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-d-Interp-7" id="107-d-Interp-7"><strong>7. Collection of gross annual revenue in the same calendar year.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(d)(1), gross annual revenue information can be reused to satisfy §&#160;1002.107(a)(14) provided it is collected in the same calendar year as the current covered application, as measured from the application date. For example, if an application is received and gross annual revenue is collected in connection with a covered application in one calendar year, but then final action was taken on the application in the following calendar year, the data may only be reused for the calendar year in which it was collected and not the calendar year in which final action was taken on the application. However, if an application is received and gross annual revenue is collected in connection with a covered application in one calendar year, a financial institution may reuse that data pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(d) in a subsequent application initiated in the same calendar year, even if final action was taken on the subsequent application in the following calendar year.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-d-Interp-8" id="107-d-Interp-8"><strong>8. Time in business.</strong> A financial institution that decides to reuse previously collected data to satisfy §&#160;1002.107(a)(17) (time in business) must update the data to reflect the passage of time since the data were collected. If a financial institution only knows that the applicant had been in business less than two years at the time the data was initially collected, as described in comment 107(a)(17)-1.ii or iii, it updates the data based on the assumption that the applicant had been in business for 12 months at the time of the prior collection. For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-d-Interp-8-i" id="107-d-Interp-8-i"><strong>i.</strong> If a financial institution previously collected data on a prior covered application that the applicant has been in business for four years, and then seeks to reuse that data for a subsequent covered application submitted one year later, it must update the data to reflect that the applicant has been in business for five years.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="107-d-Interp-8-ii" id="107-d-Interp-8-ii"><strong>ii.</strong> If a financial institution previously collected data on a prior covered application that the applicant had been in business less than two years (and was not aware of the business’s actual length of time in business at the time), and then seeks to reuse that data for a subsequent covered application submitted 18 months later, the financial institution reports time in business on the subsequent covered application as over two years in business.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="107-d-Interp-9" id="107-d-Interp-9"><strong>9. Minority-owned business status, women-owned business status, LGBTQI+-owned business status, and principal owners’ ethnicity, race, and sex.</strong> A financial institution may not reuse data to satisfy §&#160;1002.107(a)(18) and (19) unless the data were collected in connection with a prior covered application pursuant to this subpart B. If the financial institution previously asked the applicant to provide its minority-owned business status, women-owned business status, and LGBTQI+-owned business status, and principal owners’ ethnicity, race, and sex for purposes of §&#160;1002.107(a)(18) and (19), and the applicant declined to provide the information (such as by selecting “I do not wish to provide this information” or similar on a data collection form or by telling the financial institution that it did not wish to provide the information), the financial institution may use that response when reporting data for a subsequent application pursuant to §&#160;1002.107(d). However, if the applicant failed to respond (such as by leaving the response to the question blank or by failing to return a data collection form), the financial institution must inquire about the applicant’s minority-owned business status, women-owned business status, LGBTQI+-owned business status, and principal owners’ ethnicity, race, or sex, as applicable, in connection with a subsequent application because the data were not previously obtained. See also comment 107(a)(19)-11 concerning previously collected ethnicity, race, and sex information.</p>

<h3>35(a) Definitions</h3>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="35-a-1-Interp" id="35-a-1-Interp"></div>
<h3>Paragraph 35(a)(1).</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-a-1-Interp-1" id="35-a-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Comparable transaction.</strong> A higher-priced mortgage loan is a consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with an annual percentage rate that exceeds the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date the interest rate is set by the specified margin. The table of average prime offer rates published by the Bureau indicates how to identify the comparable transaction.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-a-1-Interp-2" id="35-a-1-Interp-2">2. <strong>Rate set.</strong> A transaction's annual percentage rate is compared to the average prime offer rate as of the date the transaction's interest rate is set (or “locked”) before consummation. Sometimes a creditor sets the interest rate initially and then re-sets it at a different level before consummation. The creditor should use the last date the interest rate is set before consummation.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-a-1-Interp-3" id="35-a-1-Interp-3">3. <strong>Threshold for “jumbo” loans.</strong> Section 1026.35(a)(1)(ii) provides a separate threshold for determining whether a transaction is a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to §&#160;1026.35 when the principal balance exceeds the limit in effect as of the date the transaction's rate is set for the maximum principal obligation eligible for purchase by Freddie Mac (a “jumbo” loan). The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) establishes and adjusts the maximum principal obligation pursuant to rules under 12 U.S.C. 1454(a)(2) and other provisions of federal law. Adjustments to the maximum principal obligation made by FHFA apply in determining whether a mortgage loan is a “jumbo” loan to which the separate coverage threshold in §&#160;1026.35(a)(1)(ii) applies.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="35-a-2-Interp" id="35-a-2-Interp"></div>
<h3>Paragraph 35(a)(2)</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-a-2-Interp-1" id="35-a-2-Interp-1">1. <strong>Average prime offer rate.</strong> Average prime offer rates are annual percentage rates derived from average interest rates, points, and other loan pricing terms currently offered to consumers by a representative sample of creditors for mortgage transactions that have low-risk pricing characteristics. Other pricing terms include commonly used indices, margins, and initial fixed-rate periods for variable-rate transactions. Relevant pricing characteristics include a consumer's credit history and transaction characteristics such as the loan-to-value ratio, owner-occupant status, and purpose of the transaction. To obtain average prime offer rates, the Bureau uses a survey of creditors that both meets the criteria of §&#160;1026.35(a)(2) and provides pricing terms for at least two types of variable-rate transactions and at least two types of non-variable-rate transactions. An example of such a survey is the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey®.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-a-2-Interp-2" id="35-a-2-Interp-2">2. <strong>Bureau table.</strong> The Bureau publishes on the Internet, in table form, average prime offer rates for a wide variety of transaction types. The Bureau calculates an annual percentage rate, consistent with Regulation Z (<em>see</em> §&#160;1026.22 and appendix J), for each transaction type for which pricing terms are available from a survey. The Bureau estimates annual percentage rates for other types of transactions for which direct survey data are not available based on the loan pricing terms available in the survey and other information. The Bureau publishes on the Internet the methodology it uses to arrive at these estimates.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-a-2-Interp-3" id="35-a-2-Interp-3">3. <strong>Additional guidance on determination of average prime offer rates.</strong> The average prime offer rate has the same meaning in §&#160;1026.35 as in Regulation C, 12 CFR part 1003. See 12 CFR 1003.4(a)(12)(ii). Guidance on the average prime offer rate under §&#160;1026.35(a)(2), such as when a transaction's rate is set and determination of the comparable transaction, is provided in the official commentary under Regulation C, the publication entitled “A Guide to HMDA Reporting: Getting it Right!”, and the relevant “Frequently Asked Questions” on Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) compliance posted on the FFIEC's Web site at <em>http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda.</em></p>

<h3>35(b) Escrow Accounts</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-Interp-1" id="35-b-Interp-1">1. <strong>Principal dwelling.</strong> Section 1026.35(b)(1) applies to principal dwellings, including structures that are classified as personal property under State law. For example, an escrow account must be established on a higher-priced mortgage loan secured by a first lien on a manufactured home, boat, or trailer used as the consumer's principal dwelling. <em>See</em> the commentary under §§&#160;1026.2(a)(19) and(24), 1026.15, and 1026.23. Section 1026.35(b)(1) also applies to a higher-priced mortgage loan secured by a first lien on a condominium if it is in fact used as the consumer's principal dwelling. But see §&#160;1026.35(b)(2) for exemptions from the escrow requirement that may apply to such transactions.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="35-b-1-Interp" id="35-b-1-Interp"></div>
<h3>35(b)(1) Requirement to escrow for property taxes and insurance</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-1-Interp-1" id="35-b-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Administration of escrow accounts.</strong> Section 1026.35(b)(1) requires creditors to establish an escrow account for payment of property taxes and premiums for mortgage-related insurance required by the creditor before the consummation of a higher-priced mortgage loan secured by a first lien on a principal dwelling. Section 6 of RESPA, 12 U.S.C. 2605, and Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.17, address how escrow accounts must be administered.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-1-Interp-2" id="35-b-1-Interp-2">2. <strong>Optional insurance items.</strong> Section 1026.35(b)(1) does not require that an escrow account be established for premiums for mortgage-related insurance that the creditor does not require in connection with the credit transaction, such as earthquake insurance or credit life insurance, even if the consumer voluntarily obtains such insurance.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-1-Interp-3" id="35-b-1-Interp-3">3. <strong>Transactions not subject to §&#160;1026.35(b)(1).</strong> Section 1026.35(b)(1) requires a creditor to establish an escrow account before consummation of a first-lien higher-priced mortgage loan. This requirement does not affect a creditor's ability, right, or obligation, pursuant to the terms of the legal obligation or applicable law, to offer or require an escrow account for a transaction that is not subject to §&#160;1026.35(b)(1).</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="35-b-2-Interp" id="35-b-2-Interp"></div>
<h3>35(b)(2) Exemptions.</h3>
<div class="regdown-block level-4" data-label="35-b-2-i-Interp" id="35-b-2-i-Interp"></div>
<h3>Paragraph 35(b)(2)(i).</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-2-i-Interp-1" id="35-b-2-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>Construction-permanent loans.</strong> Under §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(ii)(B), §&#160;1026.35 does not apply to a transaction to finance the initial construction of a dwelling. Section 1026.35 may apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different creditor. When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, §&#160;1026.17(c)(6)(ii) permits the creditor to give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. <em>See also</em> comment 17(c)(6)-2. Section 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) addresses only how a creditor may elect to disclose a construction-permanent transaction. Which disclosure option a creditor elects under §&#160;1026.17(c)(6)(ii) does not affect the determination of whether the permanent phase of the transaction is subject to §&#160;1026.35. When the creditor discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine whether the transaction is a higher-priced mortgage loan under §&#160;1026.35(a). When the creditor discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with §&#160;1026.22(a)(1) and appendix D to part 1026. This annual percentage rate must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine the transaction is a higher-priced mortgage loan under §&#160;1026.35(a). If the transaction is determined to be a higher-priced mortgage loan, only the permanent phase is subject to the requirement of §&#160;1026.35(b)(1) to establish and maintain an escrow account, and the period for which the escrow account must remain in place under §&#160;1026.35(b)(3) is measured from the time the conversion to the permanent phase financing occurs.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 35(b)(2)(ii).</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-2-ii-Interp-1" id="35-b-2-ii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Limited exemption.</strong> A creditor is required to escrow for payment of property taxes for all first-lien higher-priced mortgage loans secured by condominium, planned unit development, or similar dwellings or units regardless of whether the creditor escrows for insurance premiums for such dwellings or units.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-2-ii-Interp-2" id="35-b-2-ii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Planned unit developments.</strong> Planned unit developments (PUDs) are a form of property ownership often used in retirement communities, golf communities, and similar communities made up of homes located within a defined geographical area. PUDs usually have a homeowners' association or some other governing association, analogous to a condominium association and with similar authority and obligations. Thus, as with condominiums, PUDs often have master insurance policies that cover all units in the PUD. Under §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(ii), if a PUD's governing association is obligated to maintain such a master insurance policy, an escrow account required by §&#160;1026.35(b)(1) for a transaction secured by a unit in the PUD need not include escrows for insurance. This exemption applies not only to condominiums and PUDs but also to any other type of property ownership arrangement that has a governing association with an obligation to maintain a master insurance policy.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-2-ii-Interp-3" id="35-b-2-ii-Interp-3">3. <strong>More than one governing association associated with a dwelling.</strong> The limited exemption provided pursuant to §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(ii) applies to each master insurance policy for properties with multiple governing associations, to the extent each governing association has an obligation to maintain a master insurance policy.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 35(b)(2)(iii).</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Requirements for exemption.</strong> Under §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii), except as provided in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(v), a creditor need not establish an escrow account for taxes and insurance for a higher-priced mortgage loan, provided the following four conditions are satisfied when the higher-priced mortgage loan is consummated:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-i" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-i">i. During the preceding calendar year, or during either of the two preceding calendar years if the application for the loan was received before April 1 of the current calendar year, a creditor extended a first-lien covered transaction, as defined in §&#160;1026.43(b)(1), secured by a property located in an area that is either “rural” or “underserved,” as set forth in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iv).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-i-A" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-i-A">A. In general, whether the rural-or-underserved test is satisfied depends on the creditor's activity during the preceding calendar year. However, if the application for the loan in question was received before April 1 of the current calendar year, the creditor may instead meet the rural-or-underserved test based on its activity during the next-to-last calendar year. This provides creditors with a grace period if their activity meets the rural-or-underserved test (in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(A)) in one calendar year but fails to meet it in the next calendar year.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-i-B" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-i-B">B. A creditor meets the rural-or-underserved test for any higher-priced mortgage loan consummated during a calendar year if it extended a first-lien covered transaction in the preceding calendar year secured by a property located in a rural-or-underserved area. If the creditor does not meet the rural-or-underserved test in the preceding calendar year, the creditor meets this condition for a higher-priced mortgage loan consummated during the current calendar year only if the application for the loan was received before April 1 of the current calendar year and the creditor extended a first-lien covered transaction during the next-to-last calendar year that is secured by a property located in a rural or underserved area. The following examples are illustrative:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-i-B-1" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-i-B-1"><strong>1.</strong> Assume that a creditor extended during 2016 a first-lien covered transaction that is secured by a property located in a rural or underserved area. Because the creditor extended a first-lien covered transaction during 2016 that is secured by a property located in a rural or underserved area, the creditor can meet this condition for exemption for any higher-priced mortgage loan consummated during 2017.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-i-B-2" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-i-B-2"><strong>2.</strong> Assume that a creditor did not extend during 2016 a first-lien covered transaction secured by a property that is located in a rural or underserved area. Assume further that the same creditor extended during 2015 a first-lien covered transaction that is located in a rural or underserved area. Assume further that the creditor consummates a higher-priced mortgage loan in 2017 for which the application was received in November 2017. Because the creditor did not extend during 2016 a first-lien covered transaction secured by a property that is located in a rural or underserved area, and the application was received on or after April 1, 2017, the creditor does not meet this condition for exemption. However, assume instead that the creditor consummates a higher-priced mortgage loan in 2017 based on an application received in February 2017. The creditor meets this condition for exemption for this loan because the application was received before April 1, 2017, and the creditor extended during 2015 a first-lien covered transaction that is located in a rural or underserved area.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-ii" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-ii">ii. The creditor and its affiliates together extended no more than 2,000 covered transactions, as defined in §&#160;1026.43(b)(1), secured by first liens, that were sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred by the creditor or its affiliates to another person, or that were subject at the time of consummation to a commitment to be acquired by another person, during the preceding calendar year or during either of the two preceding calendar years if the application for the loan was received before April 1 of the current calendar year. For purposes of §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B), a transfer of a first-lien covered transaction to “another person” includes a transfer by a creditor to its affiliate.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-ii-A" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-ii-A">A. In general, whether this condition is satisfied depends on the creditor's activity during the preceding calendar year. However, if the application for the loan in question is received before April 1 of the current calendar year, the creditor may instead meet this condition based on activity during the next-to-last calendar year. This provides creditors with a grace period if their activity falls at or below the threshold in one calendar year but exceeds it in the next calendar year.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-ii-B" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-ii-B">B. For example, assume that in 2015 a creditor and its affiliates together extended 1,500 loans that were sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred by the creditor or its affiliates to another person, or that were subject at the time of consummation to a commitment to be acquired by another person, and 2,500 such loans in 2016. Because the 2016 transaction activity exceeds the threshold but the 2015 transaction activity does not, the creditor satisfies this condition for exemption for a higher-priced mortgage loan consummated during 2017 if the creditor received the application for the loan before April 1, 2017, but does not satisfy this condition for a higher-priced mortgage loan consummated during 2017 if the application for the loan was received on or after April 1, 2017.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-ii-C" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-ii-C">C. For purposes of §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B), extensions of first-lien covered transactions, during the applicable time period, by all of a creditor's affiliates, as “affiliate” is defined in §&#160;1026.32(b)(5), are counted toward the threshold in this section. “Affiliate” is defined in §&#160;1026.32(b)(5) as “any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another company, as set forth in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841 <em>et seq.</em>).”  Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a company has control over a bank or another company if it “directly or indirectly or acting through one or more persons owns, controls, or has power to vote 25 per centum or more of any class of voting securities of the bank or company”; it “controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors or trustees of the bank or company”; or the Federal Reserve Board “determines, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the company directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or company.” 12 U.S.C. 1841(a)(2).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-iii" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-iii">iii. As of the end of the preceding calendar year, or as of the end of either of the two preceding calendar years if the application for the loan was received before April 1 of the current calendar year, the creditor and its affiliates that regularly extended covered transactions secured by first liens, together, had total assets that are less than the applicable annual asset threshold.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-iii-A" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-iii-A">A. For purposes of §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C), in addition to the creditor's assets, only the assets of a creditor's “affiliate” (as defined by §&#160;1026.32(b)(5)) that regularly extended covered transactions (as defined by §&#160;1026.43(b)(1)) secured by first liens, are counted toward the applicable annual asset threshold. <em>See</em> comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.ii.C for discussion of definition of “affiliate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-iii-B" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-iii-B">B. Only the assets of a creditor's affiliate that regularly extended first-lien covered transactions during the applicable period are included in calculating the creditor's assets. The meaning of “regularly extended” is based on the number of times a person extends consumer credit for purposes of the definition of “creditor” in §&#160;1026.2(a)(17). Because covered transactions are “transactions secured by a dwelling,” consistent with §&#160;1026.2(a)(17)(v), an affiliate regularly extended covered transactions if it extended more than five covered transactions in a calendar year. Also consistent with §&#160;1026.2(a)(17)(v), because a covered transaction may be a high-cost mortgage subject to §&#160;1026.32, an affiliate regularly extends covered transactions if, in any 12-month period, it extends more than one covered transaction that is subject to the requirements of §&#160;1026.32 or one or more such transactions through a mortgage broker. Thus, if a creditor's affiliate regularly extended first-lien covered transactions during the preceding calendar year, the creditor's assets as of the end of the preceding calendar year, for purposes of the asset limit, take into account the assets of that affiliate. If the creditor, together with its affiliates that regularly extended first-lien covered transactions, exceeded the asset limit in the preceding calendar year - to be eligible to operate as a small creditor for transactions with applications received before April 1 of the current calendar year - the assets of the creditor's affiliates that regularly extended covered transactions in the year before the preceding calendar year are included in calculating the creditor's assets.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-iii-C" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-iii-C">C. If multiple creditors share ownership of a company that regularly extended first-lien covered transactions, the assets of the company count toward the asset limit for a co-owner creditor if the company is an “affiliate,” as defined in §&#160;1026.32(b)(5), of the co-owner creditor. Assuming the company is not an affiliate of the co-owner creditor by virtue of any other aspect of the definition (such as by the company and co-owner creditor being under common control), the company's assets are included toward the asset limit of the co-owner creditor only if the company is controlled by the co-owner creditor, “as set forth in the Bank Holding Company Act.” If the co-owner creditor and the company are affiliates (by virtue of any aspect of the definition), the co-owner creditor counts all of the company's assets toward the asset limit, regardless of the co-owner creditor's ownership share. Further, because the co-owner and the company are mutual affiliates the company also would count all of the co-owner's assets towards its own asset limit. <em>See</em> comment 35(b)(2)(iii)-1.ii.C for discussion of the definition of “affiliate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-iii-D" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-iii-D">D. A creditor satisfies the criterion in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C) for purposes of any higher-priced mortgage loan consummated during 2016, for example, if the creditor (together with its affiliates that regularly extended first-lien covered transactions) had total assets of less than the applicable asset threshold on December 31, 2015. A creditor that (together with its affiliates that regularly extended first-lien covered transactions) did not meet the applicable asset threshold on December 31, 2015 satisfies this criterion for a higher-priced mortgage loan consummated during 2016 if the application for the loan was received before April 1, 2016 and the creditor (together with its affiliates that regularly extended first-lien covered transactions) had total assets of less than the applicable asset threshold on December 31, 2014.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-iii-E" id="35-b-2-iii-Interp-1-iii-E">E. Under §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(C), the $2,000,000,000 asset threshold adjusts automatically each year based on the year-to-year change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, not seasonally adjusted, for each 12-month period ending in November, with rounding to the nearest million dollars. The Bureau will publish notice of the asset threshold each year by amending this comment. For calendar year 2021, the asset threshold is $2,230,000,000. A creditor that together with the assets of its affiliates that regularly extended first-lien covered transactions during calendar year 2020 has total assets of less than $2,230,000,000 on December 31, 2020, satisfies this criterion for purposes of any loan consummated in 2021 and for purposes of any loan consummated in 2022 for which the application was received before April 1, 2022.

For purposes of §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A)(<em>1</em>), “adjacent” has the meaning applied by the USDA-ERS in determining a county's UIC; as so applied, “adjacent” entails a county not only being physically contiguous with a metropolitan statistical area but also meeting certain minimum population commuting patterns. A county is a “rural” area under §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A)(<em>1</em>) if the USDA-ERS categorizes the county under UIC 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12. Descriptions of UICs are available on the USDA-ERS Web site at <em>http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/urban-influence-codes/documentation.aspx.</em> A county for which there is no currently applicable UIC (because the county has been created since the USDA-ERS last categorized counties) is a rural area only if all counties from which the new county's land was taken are themselves rural under currently applicable UICs.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-b-2-iv-Interp-1-ii" id="35-b-2-iv-Interp-1-ii">ii. Under §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B), an area is underserved during a calendar year if, according to Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data for the preceding calendar year, it is a county in which no more than two creditors extended covered transactions, as defined in §&#160;1026.43(b)(1), secured by first liens, five or more times on properties in the county. Specifically, a county is an “underserved” area if, in the applicable calendar year's public HMDA aggregate dataset, no more than two creditors have reported five or more first-lien covered transactions, with HMDA geocoding that places the properties in that county.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-b-2-iv-Interp-1-iii" id="35-b-2-iv-Interp-1-iii">iii. </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iv-Interp-1-iii-A" id="35-b-2-iv-Interp-1-iii-A">A. Each calendar year, the Bureau applies the “underserved” area test and the “rural” area test to each county in the United States. If a county satisfies either test, the Bureau will include the county on a list of counties that are rural or underserved as defined by §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A)(<em>1</em>) or §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(B) for a particular calendar year, even if the county contains census blocks that are designated by the Census Bureau as urban. To facilitate compliance with appraisal requirements in §&#160;1026.35(c), the Bureau also creates a list of those counties that are rural under the Bureau's definition without regard to whether the counties are underserved. To the extent that U.S. territories are treated by the Census Bureau as counties and are neither metropolitan statistical areas nor micropolitan statistical areas adjacent to metropolitan statistical areas, such territories will be included on these lists as rural areas in their entireties. The Bureau will post on its public Web site the applicable lists for each calendar year by the end of that year to assist creditors in ascertaining the availability to them of the exemption during the following year. Any county that the Bureau includes on these lists of counties that are rural or underserved under the Bureau's definitions for a particular year is deemed to qualify as a rural or underserved area for that calendar year for purposes of §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iv), even if the county contains census blocks that are designated by the Census Bureau as urban. A property located in such a listed county is deemed to be located in a rural or underserved area, even if the census block in which the property is located is designated as urban.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iv-Interp-1-iii-B" id="35-b-2-iv-Interp-1-iii-B">B. A property is deemed to be in a rural or underserved area according to the definitions in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iv) during a particular calendar year if it is identified as such by an automated tool provided on the Bureau's public Web site. A printout or electronic copy from the automated tool provided on the Bureau's public Web site designating a particular property as being in a rural or underserved area may be used as “evidence of compliance” that a property is in a rural or underserved area, as defined in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B), for purposes of the record retention requirements in §&#160;1026.25.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iv-Interp-1-iii-C" id="35-b-2-iv-Interp-1-iii-C">C. The U.S. Census Bureau may provide on its public Web site an automated address search tool that specifically indicates if a property is located in an urban area for purposes of the Census Bureau's most recent delineation of urban areas. For any calendar year that began after the date on which the Census Bureau announced its most recent delineation of urban areas, a property is deemed to be in a rural area if the search results provided for the property by any such automated address search tool available on the Census Bureau's public Web site do not designate the property as being in an urban area. A printout or electronic copy from such an automated address search tool available on the Census Bureau's public Web site designating a particular property as not being in an urban area may be used as “evidence of compliance” that the property is in a rural area, as defined in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A), for purposes of the record retention requirements in §&#160;1026.25.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="35-b-2-iv-Interp-1-iii-D" id="35-b-2-iv-Interp-1-iii-D">D. For a given calendar year, a property qualifies for a safe harbor if any of the enumerated safe harbors affirms that the property is in a rural or underserved area or not in an urban area. For example, the Census Bureau's automated address search tool may indicate a property is in an urban area, but the Bureau's rural or underserved counties list indicates the property is in a rural or underserved county. The property in this example is in a rural or underserved area because it qualifies under the safe harbor for the rural or underserved counties list. The lists of counties posted on the Bureau's public Web site, the automated tool on its public Web site, and the automated address search tool available on the Census Bureau's public Web site, are not the exclusive means by which a creditor can demonstrate that a property is in a rural or underserved area as defined in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B). However, creditors are required to retain “evidence of compliance” in accordance with §&#160;1026.25, including determinations of whether a property is in a rural or underserved area as defined in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A) and (B).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-2-iv-Interp-2" id="35-b-2-iv-Interp-2">2. <strong>Examples.</strong> </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-b-2-iv-Interp-2-i" id="35-b-2-iv-Interp-2-i">i. An area is considered “rural” for a given calendar year based on the most recent available UIC designations by the USDA-ERS and the most recent available delineations of urban areas by the U.S. Census Bureau that are available at the beginning of the calendar year. These designations and delineations are updated by the USDA-ERS and the U.S. Census Bureau respectively once every ten years. As an example, assume a creditor makes first-lien covered transactions in Census Block X that is located in County Y during calendar year 2017. As of January 1, 2017, the most recent UIC designations were published in the second quarter of 2013, and the most recent delineation of urban areas was announced in the Federal Register in 2012, <em>see</em> U.S. Census Bureau, <em>Qualifying Urban Areas for the 2010 Census,</em> 77 FR 18652 (Mar. 27, 2012). To determine whether County Y is rural under the Bureau's definition during calendar year 2017, the creditor can use USDA-ERS's 2013 UIC designations. If County Y is not rural, the creditor can use the U.S. Census Bureau's 2012 delineation of urban areas to determine whether Census Block X is rural and is therefore a “rural” area for purposes of §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A). </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-b-2-iv-Interp-2-ii" id="35-b-2-iv-Interp-2-ii">ii. A county is considered an “underserved” area for a given calendar year based on the most recent available HMDA data. For example, assume a creditor makes first-lien covered transactions in County Y during calendar year 2016, and the most recent HMDA data are for calendar year 2015, published in the third quarter of 2016. The creditor will use the 2015 HMDA data to determine “underserved” area status for County Y in calendar year 2016 for the purposes of qualifying for the “rural or underserved” exemption for any higher-priced mortgage loans consummated in calendar year 2017 or for any higher-priced mortgage loan consummated during 2018 for which the application was received before April 1, 2018.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 35(b)(2)(v).</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-2-v-Interp-1" id="35-b-2-v-Interp-1">1. <strong>Forward commitments.</strong> A creditor may make a mortgage loan that will be transferred or sold to a purchaser pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into at or before the time the loan is consummated. Such an agreement is sometimes known as a “forward commitment.” Even if a creditor is otherwise eligible for an exemption in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii) or §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(vi), a first-lien higher-priced mortgage loan that will be acquired by a purchaser pursuant to a forward commitment is subject to the requirement to establish an escrow account under §&#160;1026.35(b)(1) unless the purchaser is also eligible for an exemption in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii) or §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(vi), or the transaction is otherwise exempt under §&#160;1026.35(b)(2). The escrow requirement applies to any such transaction, whether the forward commitment provides for the purchase and sale of the specific transaction or for the purchase and sale of mortgage obligations with certain prescribed criteria that the transaction meets. For example, assume a creditor that qualifies for an exemption in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii) or §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(vi) makes a higher-priced mortgage loan that meets the purchase criteria of an investor with which the creditor has an agreement to sell such mortgage obligations after consummation. If the investor is ineligible for an exemption in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii) or §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(vi), an escrow account must be established for the transaction before consummation in accordance with §&#160;1026.35(b)(1) unless the transaction is otherwise exempt (such as a reverse mortgage or home equity line of credit).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-2-vi-A-Interp-1" id="35-b-2-vi-A-Interp-1">1. The asset threshold in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(vi)(A) will adjust automatically each year, based on the year-to-year change in the average of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, not seasonally adjusted, for each 12-month period ending in November, with rounding to the nearest million dollars.  Unlike the asset threshold in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii) and the other thresholds in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(vi), affiliates are not considered in calculating compliance with this threshold.  The Bureau will publish notice of the asset threshold each year by amending this comment.  For calendar year 2021, the asset threshold is $10,000,000,000.  A creditor that during calendar year 2020 had assets of $10,000,000,000 or less on December 31, 2020, satisfies this criterion for purposes of any loan consummated in 2021 and for purposes of any loan secured by a first lien on a principal dwelling of a consumer consummated in 2022 for which the application was received before April 1, 2022.</p>

The transaction threshold in §1026.35(b)(2)(vi)(B) differs from the transaction threshold in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B) in two ways.  First, the threshold in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(vi)(B) is 1,000 loans secured by first liens on a principal dwelling, while the threshold in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B) is 2,000 loans secured by first liens on a dwelling.  Second, all loans made by the creditor and its affiliates secured by a first lien on a principal dwelling count toward the 1,000 loan threshold in §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(vi)(B), whether or not such loans are held in portfolio.  By contrast, under §&#160;1026.35(b)(2)(iii)(B), only loans secured by first liens on a dwelling that were sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred to another person, or that were subject at the time of consummation to a commitment to be acquired by another person, are counted toward the 2,000 loan threshold.</p>

Methods by which an underlying debt obligation may be terminated include, among other things, repayment, refinancing, rescission, and foreclosure.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-3-Interp-2" id="35-b-3-Interp-2">2. <strong>Minimum durations.</strong> Section 1026.35(b)(3) establishes minimum durations for which escrow accounts established pursuant to §&#160;1026.35(b)(1) must be maintained. This requirement does not affect a creditor's right or obligation, pursuant to the terms of the legal obligation or applicable law, to offer or require an escrow account thereafter.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-b-3-Interp-3" id="35-b-3-Interp-3">3. <strong>Less than eighty percent unpaid principal balance.</strong> The term “original value” in §&#160;1026.35(b)(3)(ii)(A) means the lesser of the sales price reflected in the sales contract for the property, if any, or the appraised value of the property at the time the transaction was consummated. In determining whether the unpaid principal balance has reached less than 80 percent of the original value of the property securing the underlying debt, the creditor or servicer shall count any subordinate lien of which it has reason to know. If the consumer certifies in writing that the equity in the property securing the underlying debt obligation is unencumbered by a subordinate lien, the creditor or servicer may rely upon the certification in making its determination unless it has actual knowledge to the contrary.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-c-2-i-Interp-1-i" id="35-c-2-i-Interp-1-i">i. The loan is - (1) subject to the Bureau's ability-to-repay requirements in §&#160;1026.43 as a “covered transaction” (defined in §&#160;1026.43(b)(1)) and (2) a qualified mortgage pursuant to the Bureau's rules or, for loans insured, guaranteed, or administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), or Rural Housing Service (RHS), a qualified mortgage pursuant to applicable rules prescribed by those agencies (but only once such rules are in effect; otherwise, the Bureau's definition of a qualified mortgage applies to those loans); or</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-c-2-i-Interp-1-ii" id="35-c-2-i-Interp-1-ii">ii. The loan is - (1) not subject to the Bureau's ability-to-repay requirements in §&#160;1026.43 as a “covered transaction” (defined in §&#160;1026.43(b)(1)), but (2) meets the criteria for a qualified mortgage in the Bureau's rules or, for loans insured, guaranteed, or administered by HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS, meets the criteria for a qualified mortgage in the applicable rules prescribed by those agencies (but only once such rules are in effect; otherwise, the Bureau's criteria for a qualified mortgage applies to those loans). To explain further, loans enumerated in §&#160;1026.43(a) are not “covered transactions” under the Bureau's ability-to-repay requirements in §&#160;1026.43, and thus cannot be qualified mortgages (entitled to a rebuttable presumption or safe harbor of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements of §&#160;1026.43, <em>see, e.g.</em>, §&#160;1026.43(e)(1)). These include an extension of credit made pursuant to a program administered by a Housing Finance Agency, as defined under 24 CFR 266.5, or pursuant to a program authorized by sections 101 and 109 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. <em>See</em> §&#160;1026.43(a)(3)(iv) and (vi). They also include extensions of credit made by a creditor identified in §&#160;1026.43(a)(3)(v). However, these loans are eligible for the exemption in §&#160;1026.35(c)(2)(i) if they meet the Bureau's qualified mortgage criteria in §&#160;1026.43(e)(2), (4), (5), or (6) or §&#160;1026.43(f) (including limits on when loans must be consummated) or, for loans that are insured, guaranteed, or administered by HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS, in applicable rules prescribed by those agencies (but only once such rules are in effect; otherwise, the Bureau's criteria for a qualified mortgage applies to those loans). For example, assume that HUD has prescribed rules to define loans insured under its programs that are qualified mortgages and those rules are in effect. Assume further that a creditor designated as a Community Development Financial Institution, as defined under 12 CFR 1805.104(h), originates a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which is a part of HUD. The loan is not a “covered transaction” and thus is not a qualified mortgage. <em>See</em> §&#160;1026.43(a)(3)(v)(A) and (b)(1). Nonetheless, the transaction is eligible for an exemption from the appraisal requirements of §&#160;1026.35(c) if it meets the qualified mortgage criteria in HUD's rules. Nothing in §&#160;1026.35(c)(2)(i) alters the definition of a qualified mortgage under regulations of the Bureau, HUD, VA, USDA, or RHS.</p>

The threshold amount is adjusted effective January 1 of each year by any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) that was in effect on the preceding June 1. Comment 35(c)(2)(ii)-3 will be amended to provide the threshold amount for the upcoming year after the annual percentage change in the CPI-W that was in effect on June 1 becomes available. Any increase in the threshold amount will be rounded to the nearest $100 increment. For example, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $950 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $1,000. However, if the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W would result in a $949 increase in the threshold amount, the threshold amount will be increased by $900.</p>

For example, assume a closed-end loan that qualified for a §&#160;1026.35(c)(2)(ii) exemption at consummation in year one is refinanced in year ten and that the new loan amount is greater than the threshold amount in effect in year ten. In these circumstances, the creditor must comply with all of the applicable requirements of §&#160;1026.35(c) with respect to the year ten transaction if the original loan is satisfied and replaced by the new loan, unless another exemption from the requirements of §&#160;1026.35(c) applies. <em>See</em> §&#160;1026.35(c)(2) and (c)(4)(vii).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-2-iv-Interp-1" id="35-c-2-iv-Interp-1">1. <strong>Construction-to-permanent loans.</strong> Section 1026.35(c) does not apply to a transaction to finance the initial construction of a dwelling. This exclusion applies to a construction-only loan as well as to the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. Section 1026.35(c) does apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different creditor, unless the permanent financing is otherwise exempt from the requirements of §&#160;1026.35(c). <em>See</em> §&#160;1026.35(c)(2). When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the general disclosure requirements for closed-end credit (§&#160;1026.17) provide that the creditor may give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. <em>See</em> §&#160;1026.17(c)(6)(ii) and comment 17(c)(6)-2. Section 1026.17(c)(6)(ii) addresses only how a creditor may elect to disclose a construction-to-permanent transaction. Which disclosure option a creditor elects under §&#160;1026.17(c)(6)(ii) does not affect the determination of whether the permanent phase of the transaction is subject to §&#160;1026.35(c). When the creditor discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under §&#160;1026.35(c). When the creditor discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with §&#160;1026.35 and appendix D to part 1026. The annual percentage rate must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under §&#160;1026.35(c). If the transaction is determined to be a higher-priced mortgage loan not otherwise exempt under §&#160;1026.35(c)(2), only the permanent phase is subject to the requirements of §&#160;1026.35(c).</p>

The exemption does not apply, for example, to loans to finance the purchase of manufactured homes that have not been or are in the process of being built when the financing obtained by the consumer at that time is permanent. <em>See</em> §&#160;1026.35(c)(2)(viii).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-2-vii-A-1-Interp-1" id="35-c-2-vii-A-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Same credit risk holder.</strong> The requirement that the holder of the credit risk on the existing obligation and the refinancing be the same applies to situations in which an entity bears the financial responsibility for the default of a loan by either holding the loan in its portfolio or guaranteeing payments of principal and any interest to investors in a mortgage-backed security in which the loan is pooled. <em>See</em> §&#160;1026.35(c)(1)(ii) (defining “credit risk”). For example, a credit risk holder could be a bank that bears the credit risk on the existing obligation by holding the loan in the bank's portfolio. Another example of a credit risk holder would be a government-sponsored enterprise that bears the risk of default on a loan by guaranteeing the payment of principal and any interest on a loan to investors in a mortgage-backed security. The holder of credit risk under §&#160;1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em>1</em>) does not mean individual investors in a mortgage-backed security or providers of private mortgage insurance.</p>

The existing obligation is held in the portfolio of a bank, thus the bank holds the credit risk. The bank arranges to refinance the loan and also will hold the refinancing in its portfolio. If the refinancing otherwise meets the requirements for an exemption under §&#160;1026.35(c)(2)(vii), the transaction will qualify for the exemption because the credit risk holder is the same for the existing obligation and the refinance transaction. In this case, the exemption would apply regardless of whether the bank arranged to refinance the loan directly or indirectly, such as through the servicer or subservicer on the existing obligation.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-c-2-vii-A-1-Interp-2-ii" id="35-c-2-vii-A-1-Interp-2-ii">ii. The existing obligation is held in the portfolio of a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), thus the GSE holds the credit risk. The existing obligation is then refinanced by the servicer of the loan and immediately transferred to the GSE. The GSE pools the refinancing in a mortgage-backed security guaranteed by the GSE, thus the GSE holds the credit risk on the refinance loan. If the refinance transaction otherwise meets the requirements for an exemption under §&#160;1026.35(c)(2)(vii), the transaction will qualify for the exemption because the credit risk holder is the same for the existing obligation and the refinance transaction. In this case, the exemption would apply regardless of whether the existing obligation was refinanced by the servicer or subservicer on the existing obligation (acting as a “creditor” under §&#160;1026.2(a)(17)) or by a different creditor.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-2-vii-A-1-Interp-3" id="35-c-2-vii-A-1-Interp-3">3. <strong>Forward commitments.</strong> A creditor may make a mortgage loan that will be sold or otherwise transferred pursuant to an agreement that has been entered into at or before the time the transaction is consummated. Such an agreement is sometimes known as a “forward commitment.” A refinance loan does not satisfy the requirement of §&#160;1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(A)(<em>1</em>) if the loan will be acquired pursuant to a forward commitment, such that the credit risk on the refinance loan will transfer to a person who did not hold the credit risk on the existing obligation.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-2-vii-B-Interp-1" id="35-c-2-vii-B-Interp-1">1. <strong>Regular periodic payments.</strong> Under §&#160;1026.35(c)(2)(vii)(B), the regular periodic payments on the refinance loan must not: result in an increase of the principal balance (negative amortization); allow the consumer to defer repayment of principal (<em>see</em> comment 43(e)(2)(i)-2); or result in a balloon payment. Thus, the terms of the legal obligation must require the consumer to make payments of principal and interest on a monthly or other periodic basis that will repay the loan amount over the loan term. Except for payments resulting from any interest rate changes after consummation in an adjustable-rate or step-rate mortgage, the periodic payments must be substantially equal. For an explanation of the term “substantially equal,” see comment 43(c)(5)(i)-4. In addition, a single-payment transaction is not a refinancing meeting the requirements of §&#160;1026.35(c)(2)(vii) because it does not require “regular periodic payments.”</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-2-vii-C-Interp-1" id="35-c-2-vii-C-Interp-1">1. <strong>Permissible use of proceeds.</strong> The exemption for a refinancing under §&#160;1026.35(c)(2)(vii) is available only if the proceeds from the refinancing are used exclusively for the existing obligation and amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. The existing obligation includes the unpaid principal balance of the existing first lien loan, any earned unpaid finance charges, and any other lawful charges related to the existing loan. For guidance on the meaning of refinancing costs, see comment 23(f)-4. If the proceeds of a refinancing are used for other purposes, such as to pay off other liens or to provide additional cash to the consumer for discretionary spending, the transaction does not qualify for the exemption for a refinancing under §&#160;1026.35(c)(2)(vii) from the appraisal requirements in §&#160;1026.35(c).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-4-v-Interp-1" id="35-c-4-v-Interp-1">1. <strong>Fees and mark-ups.</strong> The creditor is prohibited from charging the consumer for the performance of one of the two appraisals required under §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(i), including by imposing a fee specifically for that appraisal or by marking up the interest rate or any other fees payable by the consumer in connection with the higher-priced mortgage loan.</p>

<h3>35(c)(4)(vi) Creditor's Determination of Prior Sale Date and Price</h3>
<div class="regdown-block level-5" data-label="35-c-4-vi-A-Interp" id="35-c-4-vi-A-Interp"></div>
<h3>35(c)(4)(vi)(A) In General</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-4-vi-A-Interp-1" id="35-c-4-vi-A-Interp-1">1. <strong>Estimated sales price.</strong> If a written source document describes the seller's acquisition price in a manner that indicates that the price described is an estimated or assumed amount and not the actual price, the creditor should look at an alternative document to satisfy the reasonable diligence standard in determining the price at which the seller acquired the property.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-4-vi-A-Interp-2" id="35-c-4-vi-A-Interp-2">2. <strong>Reasonable diligence - oral statements insufficient.</strong> Reliance on oral statements of interested parties, such as the consumer, seller, or mortgage broker, does not constitute reasonable diligence under §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(vi)(A).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-4-vi-A-Interp-3" id="35-c-4-vi-A-Interp-3">3. <strong>Lack of information and conflicting information - two appraisals required.</strong> If a creditor is unable to demonstrate that the requirement to obtain two appraisals under §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(i) does not apply, the creditor must obtain two written appraisals before extending a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to the requirements of §&#160;1026.35(c). <em>See also</em> comment 35(c)(4)(vi)(B)-1. For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-c-4-vi-A-Interp-3-i" id="35-c-4-vi-A-Interp-3-i">i. Assume a creditor orders and reviews the results of a title search, which shows that a prior sale occurred between 91 and 180 days ago, but not the price paid in that sale. Thus, based on the title search, the creditor would not be able to determine whether the price the consumer is obligated to pay under the consumer's acquisition agreement is more than 20 percent higher than the seller's acquisition price, pursuant to §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(i)(B). Before extending a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to the appraisal requirements of §&#160;1026.35(c), the creditor must either: (1) Perform additional diligence to ascertain the seller's acquisition price and, based on this information, determine whether two written appraisals are required; or (2) obtain two written appraisals in compliance with §&#160;1026.35(c)(4). <em>See also</em> comment 35(c)(4)(vi)(B)-1.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-c-4-vi-A-Interp-3-ii" id="35-c-4-vi-A-Interp-3-ii">ii. Assume a creditor reviews the results of a title search indicating that the last recorded purchase was more than 180 days before the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. Assume also that the creditor subsequently receives a written appraisal indicating that the seller acquired the property between 91 and 180 days before the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. In this case, unless one of these sources is clearly wrong on its face, the creditor would not be able to determine whether the seller acquired the property within 180 days of the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property from the seller, pursuant to §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(i)(B). Before extending a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to the appraisal requirements of §&#160;1026.35(c), the creditor must either: perform additional diligence to ascertain the seller's acquisition date and, based on this information, determine whether two written appraisals are required; or obtain two written appraisals in compliance with §&#160;1026.35(c)(4). <em>See also</em> comment 35(c)(4)(vi)(B)-1.</p>

<h3>35(c)(4)(vi)(B) Inability To Determine Prior Sales Date or Price - Modified Requirements for Additional Appraisal</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-4-vi-B-Interp-1" id="35-c-4-vi-B-Interp-1">1. <strong>Required analysis.</strong> In general, the additional appraisal required under §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(i) should include an analysis of the factors listed in §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(A) through (C). However, if, following reasonable diligence, a creditor cannot determine whether the conditions in §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(i)(A) or (B) are present due to a lack of information or conflicting information, the required additional appraisal must include the analyses required under §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(A) through (C) only to the extent that the information necessary to perform the analyses is known. For example, assume that a creditor is able, following reasonable diligence, to determine that the date on which the seller acquired the property occurred between 91 and 180 days prior to the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. However, the creditor is unable, following reasonable diligence, to determine the price at which the seller acquired the property. In this case, the creditor is required to obtain an additional written appraisal that includes an analysis under §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(B) and (c)(4)(iv)(C) of the changes in market conditions and any improvements made to the property between the date the seller acquired the property and the date of the consumer's agreement to acquire the property. However, the creditor is not required to obtain an additional written appraisal that includes analysis under §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(iv)(A) of the difference between the price at which the seller acquired the property and the price that the consumer is obligated to pay to acquire the property.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 35(c)(4)(vii)(C)</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-4-vii-C-Interp-1" id="35-c-4-vii-C-Interp-1">1. <strong>Non-profit entity.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(C), a “non-profit entity” is a person with a tax exemption ruling or determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-4-vii-H-Interp-1" id="35-c-4-vii-H-Interp-1">1. <strong>Bureau table of rural counties.</strong> The Bureau publishes on its Web site a table of rural counties under §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H) for each calendar year by the end of that calendar year. <em>See</em> comment 35(b)(2)(iv)-1. A property securing an HPML subject to §&#160;1026.35(c) is in a rural county under §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H) if the county in which the property is located is on the table of rural counties most recently published by the Bureau. For example, for a transaction occurring in 2015, assume that the Bureau most recently published a table of rural counties at the end of 2014. The property securing the transaction would be located in a rural county for purposes of §&#160;1026.35(c)(4)(vii)(H) if the county is on the table of rural counties published by the Bureau at the end of 2014.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-5-i-Interp-1" id="35-c-5-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>Multiple applicants.</strong> When two or more consumers apply for a loan subject to this section, the creditor is required to give the disclosure to only one of the consumers.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-5-i-Interp-2" id="35-c-5-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>Appraisal independence requirements not affected.</strong> Nothing in the text of the consumer notice required by §&#160;1026.35(c)(5)(i) should be construed to affect, modify, limit, or supersede the operation of any legal, regulatory, or other requirements or standards relating to independence in the conduct of appraisers or restrictions on the use of borrower-ordered appraisals by creditors.</p>

<h3>35(c)(6)(ii) Timing</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-6-ii-Interp-1" id="35-c-6-ii-Interp-1">1. <strong>“Provide.”</strong> For purposes of the requirement to provide a copy of the appraisal within a specified time under §&#160;1026.35(c)(6)(ii), “provide” means “deliver.” Delivery occurs three business days after mailing or delivering the copies to the last-known address of the applicant, or when evidence indicates actual receipt by the applicant (which, in the case of electronic receipt, must be based upon consent that complies with the E-Sign Act), whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-c-6-ii-Interp-2" id="35-c-6-ii-Interp-2">2. <strong>No waiver.</strong> Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.14(a)(1), allowing the consumer to waive the requirement that the appraisal copy be provided three business days before consummation, does not apply to higher-priced mortgage loans subject to §&#160;1026.35(c). A consumer of a higher-priced mortgage loan subject to §&#160;1026.35(c) may not waive the timing requirement to receive a copy of the appraisal under §&#160;1026.35(c)(6)(i).</p>

<div class="regdown-block level-5" data-label="35-e-2-ii-C-Interp" id="35-e-2-ii-C-Interp"></div>
<h3>Paragraph 35(e)(2)(ii)(C)</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-e-2-ii-C-Interp-1" id="35-e-2-ii-C-Interp-1">1. <strong>Payment change.</strong> Section 1026.35(e)(2) provides that a loan subject to this section may not have a penalty described by §&#160;1026.32(d)(6) unless certain conditions are met. Section 1026.35(e)(2)(ii)(C) lists as a condition that the amount of the periodic payment of principal or interest or both may not change during the four-year period following consummation. For examples showing whether a prepayment penalty is permitted or prohibited in connection with particular payment changes, see comment 32(d)(7)(iv)-1. Those examples, however, include a condition that §&#160;1026.35(e)(2) does not include: The condition that, at consummation, the consumer's total monthly debt payments may not exceed 50 percent of the consumer's monthly gross income. For guidance about circumstances in which payment changes are not considered payment changes for purposes of this section, see comment 32(d)(7)(iv)-2.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="35-e-2-ii-C-Interp-2" id="35-e-2-ii-C-Interp-2">2. <strong>Negative amortization.</strong> Section 1026.32(d)(2) provides that a loan described in §&#160;1026.32(a) may not have a payment schedule with regular periodic payments that cause the principal balance to increase. Therefore, the commentary to §&#160;1026.32(d)(7)(iv) does not include examples of payment changes in connection with negative amortization. The following examples show whether, under §&#160;1026.35(e)(2), prepayment penalties are permitted or prohibited in connection with particular payment changes, when a loan agreement permits negative amortization:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-e-2-ii-C-Interp-2-i" id="35-e-2-ii-C-Interp-2-i">i. Initial payments for a variable-rate transaction consummated on January 1, 2010, are $1,000 per month and the loan agreement permits negative amortization to occur. Under the loan agreement, the first date that a scheduled payment in a different amount may be due is January 1, 2014, and the creditor does not have the right to change scheduled payments prior to that date even if negative amortization occurs. A prepayment penalty is permitted with this mortgage transaction provided that the other §&#160;1026.35(e)(2) conditions are met, that is: Provided that the prepayment penalty is permitted by other applicable law, the penalty expires on or before December 31, 2011, and the penalty will not apply if the source of the prepayment funds is a refinancing by the creditor or its affiliate.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="35-e-2-ii-C-Interp-2-ii" id="35-e-2-ii-C-Interp-2-ii">ii. Initial payments for a variable-rate transaction consummated on January 1, 2010 are $1,000 per month and the loan agreement permits negative amortization to occur. Under the loan agreement, the first date that a scheduled payment in a different amount may be due is January 1, 2014, but the creditor has the right to change scheduled payments prior to that date if negative amortization occurs. A prepayment penalty is prohibited with this mortgage transaction because the payment may change within the four-year period following consummation.</p>

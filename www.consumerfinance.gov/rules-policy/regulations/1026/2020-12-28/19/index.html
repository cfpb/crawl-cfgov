        <div class="regdown-block level-4" data-label="19-a-1-i-Interp" id="19-a-1-i-Interp"></div>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-a-1-i-Interp-1" id="19-a-1-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>Coverage.</strong> Section 1026.19(a) requires early disclosure of credit terms in reverse mortgage transactions subject to §&#160;1026.33 that are secured by a consumer's dwelling that are also subject to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and its implementing Regulation X. To be covered by §&#160;1026.19(a), a transaction must be a Federally related mortgage loan under RESPA. “Federally related mortgage loan” is defined under RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2602) and Regulation X (12 CFR 1024.2(b)), and is subject to any interpretations by the Bureau.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-a-1-i-Interp-2" id="19-a-1-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>Timing and use of estimates.</strong> The disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(a)(1)(i) must be delivered or mailed not later than three business days after the creditor receives the consumer's written application. The general definition of “business day” in §&#160;1026.2(a)(6) - a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the public for substantially all of its business functions - is used for purposes of §&#160;1026.19(a)(1)(i). <em>See</em> comment 2(a)(6)-1. This general definition is consistent with the definition of “business day” in Regulation X - a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the public for carrying on substantially all of its business functions. <em>See</em> 12 CFR 1024.2. Accordingly, the three-business-day period in §&#160;1026.19(a)(1)(i) for making early disclosures coincides with the time period within which creditors subject to RESPA must provide good faith estimates of settlement costs. If the creditor does not know the precise credit terms, the creditor must base the disclosures on the best information reasonably available and indicate that the disclosures are estimates under §&#160;1026.17(c)(2). If many of the disclosures are estimates, the creditor may include a statement to that effect (such as “all numerical disclosures except the late-payment disclosure are estimates”) instead of separately labeling each estimate. In the alternative, the creditor may label as an estimate only the items primarily affected by unknown information. (<em>See</em> the commentary to §&#160;1026.17(c)(2).) The creditor may provide explanatory material concerning the estimates and the contingencies that may affect the actual terms, in accordance with the commentary to §&#160;1026.17(a)(1).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-a-1-i-Interp-3" id="19-a-1-i-Interp-3">3. <strong>Written application.</strong> Creditors may rely on RESPA and Regulation X (including any interpretations issued by the Bureau) in deciding whether a “written application” has been received. In general, Regulation X defines “application” to mean the submission of a borrower's financial information in anticipation of a credit decision relating to a federally related mortgage loan. <em>See</em> 12 CFR 1024.2(b). An application is received when it reaches the creditor in any of the ways applications are normally transmitted - by mail, hand delivery, or through an intermediary agent or broker. (<em>See</em> comment 19(b)-3 for guidance in determining whether or not the transaction involves an intermediary agent or broker.) If an application reaches the creditor through an intermediary agent or broker, the application is received when it reaches the creditor, rather than when it reaches the agent or broker.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-a-1-i-Interp-4" id="19-a-1-i-Interp-4">4. <strong>Denied or withdrawn applications.</strong> The creditor may determine within the three-business-day period that the application will not or cannot be approved on the terms requested, as, for example, when a consumer applies for a type or amount of credit that the creditor does not offer, or the consumer's application cannot be approved for some other reason. In that case, or if the consumer withdraws the application within the three-business-day period, the creditor need not make the disclosures under this section. If the creditor fails to provide early disclosures and the transaction is later consummated on the original terms, the creditor will be in violation of this provision. If, however, the consumer amends the application because of the creditor's unwillingness to approve it on its original terms, no violation occurs for not providing disclosures based on the original terms. But the amended application is a new application subject to §&#160;1026.19(a)(1)(i).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-a-2-ii-Interp-2" id="19-a-2-ii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Content of new disclosures.</strong> If redisclosure is required, the creditor may provide a complete set of new disclosures, or may redisclose only the changed terms. If the creditor chooses to provide a complete set of new disclosures, the creditor may but need not highlight the new terms, provided that the disclosures comply with the format requirements of §&#160;1026.17(a). If the creditor chooses to disclose only the new terms, all the new terms must be disclosed. For example, a different annual percentage rate will almost always produce a different finance charge, and often a new schedule of payments; all of these changes would have to be disclosed. If, in addition, unrelated terms such as the amount financed or prepayment penalty vary from those originally disclosed, the accurate terms must be disclosed. However, no new disclosures are required if the only inaccuracies involve estimates other than the annual percentage rate, and no variable rate feature has been added. For a discussion of the requirement to redisclose when a variable-rate feature is added, <em>see</em> comment 17(f)-2. For a discussion of redisclosure requirements in general, <em>see</em> the commentary on §&#160;1026.17(f).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-a-2-ii-Interp-3" id="19-a-2-ii-Interp-3">3. <strong>Timing.</strong> When redisclosures are necessary because the annual percentage rate has become inaccurate, they must be received by the consumer no later than the third business day before consummation. (For redisclosures triggered by other events, the creditor must provide corrected disclosures before consummation. <em>See</em> §&#160;1026.17(f).) If the creditor delivers the corrected disclosures to the consumer in person, consummation may occur any time on the third business day following delivery. If the creditor provides the corrected disclosures by mail, the consumer is considered to have received them three business days after they are placed in the mail, for purposes of determining when the three-business-day waiting period required under §&#160;1026.19(a)(2)(ii) begins. Creditors that use electronic mail or a courier other than the postal service may also follow this approach.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-a-2-ii-Interp-4" id="19-a-2-ii-Interp-4">4. <strong>Basis for annual percentage rate comparison.</strong> To determine whether a creditor must make corrected disclosures under §&#160;1026.22, a creditor compares (a) what the annual percentage rate will be at consummation to (b) the annual percentage rate stated in the most recent disclosures the creditor made to the consumer. For example, assume consummation for a regular mortgage transaction is scheduled for Thursday, June 11, the early disclosures provided in May stated an annual percentage rate of 7.00%, and corrected disclosures received by the consumer on Friday, June 5 stated an annual percentage rate of 7.15%:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-a-2-ii-Interp-4-i" id="19-a-2-ii-Interp-4-i">i. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.25%, which exceeds the most recently disclosed annual percentage rate by less than the applicable tolerance. The creditor is not required to make additional corrected disclosures or wait an additional three business days under §&#160;1026.19(a)(2).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-a-2-ii-Interp-4-ii" id="19-a-2-ii-Interp-4-ii">ii. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.30%, which exceeds the most recently disclosed annual percentage rate by more than the applicable tolerance. The creditor must make corrected disclosures such that the consumer receives them on or before Monday, June 8.</p>

The consumer must have a <em>bona fide</em> personal financial emergency that necessitates consummating the credit transaction before the end of the waiting period. Whether these conditions are met is determined by the facts surrounding individual situations. The imminent sale of the consumer's home at foreclosure, where the foreclosure sale will proceed unless loan proceeds are made available to the consumer during the waiting period, is one example of a <em>bona fide</em> personal financial emergency. Each consumer who is primarily liable on the legal obligation must sign the written statement for the waiver to be effective.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-Interp-1" id="19-b-Interp-1">1. <strong>Coverage.</strong> Section 1026.19(b) applies to all closed-end variable-rate transactions that are secured by the consumer's principal dwelling and have a term greater than one year. The requirements of this section apply not only to transactions financing the initial acquisition of the consumer's principal dwelling, but also to any other closed-end variable-rate transaction secured by the principal dwelling. Closed-end variable-rate transactions that are not secured by the principal dwelling, or are secured by the principal dwelling but have a term of one year or less, are subject to the disclosure requirements of §&#160;1026.18(f)(1) rather than those of §&#160;1026.19(b). (Furthermore, “shared-equity” or “shared-appreciation” mortgages are subject to the disclosure requirements of §&#160;1026.18(f)(1) rather than those of §&#160;1026.19(b) regardless of the general coverage of those sections.) For purposes of this section, the term of a variable-rate demand loan is determined in accordance with the commentary to §&#160;1026.17(c)(5). In determining whether a construction loan that may be permanently financed by the same creditor is covered under this section, the creditor may treat the construction and the permanent phases as separate transactions with distinct terms to maturity or as a single combined transaction. For purposes of the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.18, the creditor may nevertheless treat the two phases either as separate transactions or as a single combined transaction in accordance with §&#160;1026.17(c)(6). Finally, in any assumption of a variable-rate transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling with a term greater than one year, disclosures need not be provided under §§&#160;1026.18(f)(2)(ii) or 1026.19(b).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-Interp-2" id="19-b-Interp-2">2. <strong>Timing.</strong> A creditor must give the disclosures required under this section at the time an application form is provided or before the consumer pays a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-b-Interp-2-i" id="19-b-Interp-2-i">i. <strong>Intermediary agent or broker.</strong> In cases where a creditor receives a written application through an intermediary agent or broker, however, §&#160;1026.19(b) provides a substitute timing rule requiring the creditor to deliver the disclosures or place them in the mail not later than three business days after the creditor receives the consumer's written application. (See comment 19(b)-3 for guidance in determining whether or not the transaction involves an intermediary agent or broker.) This three-day rule also applies where the creditor takes an application over the telephone.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-b-Interp-2-ii" id="19-b-Interp-2-ii">ii. <strong>Telephone request.</strong> In cases where the consumer merely requests an application over the telephone, the creditor must include the early disclosures required under this section with the application that is sent to the consumer.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-b-Interp-2-iii" id="19-b-Interp-2-iii">iii. <strong>Mail solicitations.</strong> In cases where the creditor solicits applications through the mail, the creditor must also send the disclosures required under this section if an application form is included with the solicitation.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-b-Interp-2-iv" id="19-b-Interp-2-iv">iv. <strong>Conversion.</strong> In cases where an open-end credit account will convert to a closed-end transaction subject to this section under a written agreement with the consumer, disclosures under this section may be given at the time of conversion. (See the commentary to §&#160;1026.20(a) for information on the timing requirements for §&#160;1026.19(b)(2) disclosures when a variable-rate feature is later added to a transaction.)</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-b-Interp-2-v" id="19-b-Interp-2-v">v. <strong>Form of electronic disclosures provided on or with electronic applications.</strong> Creditors must provide the disclosures required by this section (including the brochure) on or with a blank application that is made available to the consumer in electronic form, such as on a creditor's Internet Web site. Creditors have flexibility in satisfying this requirement. There are various methods creditors could use to satisfy the requirement. Whatever method is used, a creditor need not confirm that the consumer has read the disclosures. Methods include, but are not limited to, the following examples:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-Interp-2-v-A" id="19-b-Interp-2-v-A">A. The disclosures could automatically appear on the screen when the application appears;</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-Interp-2-v-B" id="19-b-Interp-2-v-B">B. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the application (whether or not they appear on the initial screen), if the application contains a clear and conspicuous reference to the location of the disclosures and indicates that the disclosures contain rate, fee, and other cost information, as applicable;</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-Interp-2-v-C" id="19-b-Interp-2-v-C">C. Creditors could provide a link to the electronic disclosures on or with the application as long as consumers cannot bypass the disclosures before submitting the application. The link would take the consumer to the disclosures, but the consumer need not be required to scroll completely through the disclosures; or</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-Interp-2-v-D" id="19-b-Interp-2-v-D">D. The disclosures could be located on the same web page as the application without necessarily appearing on the initial screen, immediately preceding the button that the consumer will click to submit the application.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-Interp-3" id="19-b-Interp-3">3. <strong>Intermediary agent or broker.</strong> </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-b-Interp-3-i" id="19-b-Interp-3-i">i. In certain transactions involving an “intermediary agent or broker,” a creditor may delay providing disclosures. A creditor may not delay providing disclosures in transactions involving either a legal agent (as determined by applicable law) or any other third party that is not an “intermediary agent or broker.” In determining whether or not a transaction involves an “intermediary agent or broker” the following factors should be considered:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-Interp-3-i-A" id="19-b-Interp-3-i-A">A. The number of applications submitted by the broker to the creditor as compared to the total number of applications received by the creditor. The greater the percentage of total loan applications submitted by the broker in any given period of time, the less likely it is that the broker would be considered an “intermediary agent or broker” of the creditor during the next period.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-Interp-3-i-B" id="19-b-Interp-3-i-B">B. The number of applications submitted by the broker to the creditor as compared to the total number of applications received by the broker. (This factor is applicable only if the creditor has such information.) The greater the percentage of total loan applications received by the broker that is submitted to a creditor in any given period of time, the less likely it is that the broker would be considered an “intermediary agent or broker” of the creditor during the next period.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-Interp-3-i-C" id="19-b-Interp-3-i-C">C. The amount of work (such as document preparation) the creditor expects to be done by the broker on an application based on the creditor's prior dealings with the broker and on the creditor's requirements for accepting applications, taking into consideration the customary practice of brokers in a particular area. The more work that the creditor expects the broker to do on an application, in excess of what is usually expected of a broker in that area, the less likely it is that the broker would be considered an “intermediary agent or broker” of the creditor.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-b-Interp-3-ii" id="19-b-Interp-3-ii">ii. An example of an “intermediary agent or broker” is a broker who, customarily within a brief period of time after receiving an application, inquires about the credit terms of several creditors with whom the broker does business and submits the application to one of them. The broker is responsible for only a small percentage of the applications received by that creditor. During the time the broker has the application, it might request a credit report and an appraisal (or even prepare an entire loan package if customary in that particular area).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-Interp-4" id="19-b-Interp-4">4. <strong>Other variable-rate regulations.</strong> Transactions in which the creditor is required to comply with and has complied with the disclosure requirements of the variable-rate regulations of other Federal agencies are exempt from the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(b), by virtue of §&#160;1026.19(d). The exception is also available to creditors that are required by State law to comply with the Federal variable-rate regulations noted above. Creditors using this exception should comply with the timing requirements of those regulations rather than the timing requirements of Regulation Z in making the variable-rate disclosures.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-Interp-5-i-A" id="19-b-Interp-5-i-A">A. Renewable balloon-payment instruments where the creditor is both unconditionally obligated to renew the balloon-payment loan at the consumer's option (or is obligated to renew subject to conditions within the consumer's control) and has the option of increasing the interest rate at the time of renewal. (See comment 17(c)(1)-11 for a discussion of conditions within a consumer's control in connection with renewable balloon-payment loans.)</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-Interp-5-i-B" id="19-b-Interp-5-i-B">B. Preferred-rate loans where the terms of the legal obligation provide that the initial underlying rate is fixed but will increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as an employee leaving the employ of the creditor, and the note reflects the preferred rate. The disclosures under §§&#160;1026.19(b)(1) and 1026.19(b)(2)(v), (viii), (ix), and (xii) are not applicable to such loans.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-Interp-5-i-C" id="19-b-Interp-5-i-C">C. “Price-level-adjusted mortgages” or other indexed mortgages that have a fixed rate of interest but provide for periodic adjustments to payments and the loan balance to reflect changes in an index measuring prices or inflation. The disclosures under §&#160;1026.19(b)(1) are not applicable to such loans, nor are the following provisions to the extent they relate to the determination of the interest rate by the addition of a margin, changes in the interest rate, or interest rate discounts: §&#160;1026.19(b)(2)(i), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), and (ix). (See comments 20(c)(1)(ii)-3.ii, 20(d)(1)(ii)-2.ii, and 30-1 regarding the inapplicability of variable-rate adjustment notices and interest rate limitations to price-level-adjusted or similar mortgages.)</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-1" id="19-b-2-Interp-1">1. <strong>Disclosure for each variable-rate program.</strong> A creditor must provide disclosures to the consumer that fully describe each of the creditor's variable-rate loan programs in which the consumer expresses an interest. If a program is made available only to certain customers of an institution, a creditor need not provide disclosures for that program to other consumers who express a general interest in a creditor's ARM programs. Disclosures must be given at the time an application form is provided or before the consumer pays a nonrefundable fee, whichever is earlier. If program disclosures cannot be provided because a consumer expresses an interest in individually negotiating loan terms that are not generally offered, disclosures reflecting those terms may be provided as soon as reasonably possible after the terms have been decided upon, but not later than the time a non-refundable fee is paid. If a consumer who has received program disclosures subsequently expresses an interest in other available variable-rate programs subject to 1026.19(b)(2), or the creditor and consumer decide on a program for which the consumer has not received disclosures, the creditor must provide appropriate disclosures as soon as reasonably possible. The creditor, of course, is permitted to give the consumer information about additional programs subject to §&#160;1026.19(b) initially.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2" id="19-b-2-Interp-2">2. <strong>Variable-rate loan program defined.</strong> </p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2-i" id="19-b-2-Interp-2-i">i. Generally, if the identification, the presence or absence, or the exact value of a loan feature must be disclosed under this section, variable-rate loans that differ as to such features constitute separate loan programs. For example, separate loan programs would exist based on differences in any of the following loan features:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-A" id="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-A">A. The index or other formula used to calculate interest rate adjustments.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-B" id="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-B">B. The rules relating to changes in the index value, interest rate, payments, and loan balance.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-C" id="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-C">C. The presence or absence of, and the amount of, rate or payment caps.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-D" id="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-D">D. The presence of a demand feature.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-E" id="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-E">E. The possibility of negative amortization.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-F" id="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-F">F. The possibility of interest rate carryover.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-G" id="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-G">G. The frequency of interest rate and payment adjustments.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-H" id="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-H">H. The presence of a discount feature.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-I" id="19-b-2-Interp-2-i-I">I. In addition, if a loan feature must be taken into account in preparing the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(b)(2)(viii), variable-rate loans that differ as to that feature constitute separate programs under §&#160;1026.19(b)(2).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2-ii" id="19-b-2-Interp-2-ii">ii. If, however, a representative value may be given for a loan feature or the feature need not be disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(b)(2), variable-rate loans that differ as to such features do not constitute separate loan programs. For example, separate programs would not exist based on differences in the following loan features:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2-ii-A" id="19-b-2-Interp-2-ii-A">A. The amount of a discount.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-2-ii-B" id="19-b-2-Interp-2-ii-B">B. The amount of a margin.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-3" id="19-b-2-Interp-3">3. <strong>Form of program disclosures.</strong> A creditor may provide separate program disclosure forms for each ARM program it offers or a single disclosure form that describes multiple programs. A disclosure form may consist of more than one page. For example, a creditor may attach a separate page containing the historical payment example for a particular program. A disclosure form describing more than one program need not repeat information applicable to each program that is described. For example, a form describing multiple programs may disclose the information applicable to all of the programs in one place with the various program features (such as options permitting conversion to a fixed rate) disclosed separately. The form, however, must state if any program feature that is described is available only in conjunction with certain other program features. Both the separate and multiple program disclosures may illustrate more than one loan maturity or payment amortization - for example, by including multiple payment and loan balance columns in the historical payment example. Disclosures may be inserted or printed in the <em>Consumer Handbook</em> (or a suitable substitute) as long as they are identified as the creditor's loan program disclosures.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-4" id="19-b-2-Interp-4">4. <strong>As applicable.</strong> The disclosures required by this section need only be made as applicable. Any disclosure not relevant to a particular transaction may be eliminated. For example, if the transaction does not contain a demand feature, the disclosure required under §&#160;1026.19(b)(2)(x) need not be given. As used in this section, <em>payment</em> refers only to a payment based on the interest rate, loan balance and loan term, and does not refer to payment of other elements such as mortgage insurance premiums.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-Interp-5" id="19-b-2-Interp-5">5. <strong>Revisions.</strong> A creditor must revise the disclosures required under this section once a year as soon as reasonably possible after the new index value becomes available. Revisions to the disclosures also are required when the loan program changes.</p>

In cases where a creditor bases its interest rate on a specific index and adjusts the index through the addition of a margin, for example, the disclosure might read, “Your interest rate is based on the index plus a margin, and your payment will be based on the interest rate, loan balance, and remaining loan term.” In transactions where paying the periodic payments will not fully amortize the outstanding balance at the end of the loan term and where the final payment will equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, the creditor must disclose this fact. For example, the disclosure might read, “Your periodic payments will not fully amortize your loan and you will be required to make a single payment of the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance at the end of the loan term.” The creditor, however, need not reflect any irregular final payment in the historical example or in the disclosure of the initial and maximum rates and payments. If applicable, the creditor should also disclose that the rate and payment will be rounded.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-v-Interp-1" id="19-b-2-v-Interp-1">1. <strong>Discounted and premium interest rate.</strong> In some variable-rate transactions, creditors may set an initial interest rate that is not determined by the index or formula used to make later interest rate adjustments. Typically, this initial rate charged to consumers is lower than the rate would be if it were calculated using the index or formula. However, in some cases the initial rate may be higher. If the initial interest rate will be a discount or a premium rate, creditors must alert the consumer to this fact. For example, if a creditor discounted a consumer's initial rate, the disclosure might state, “Your initial interest rate is not based on the index used to make later adjustments.” (See the commentary to §&#160;1026.17(c)(1) for a further discussion of discounted and premium variable-rate transactions.) In addition, the disclosure must suggest that consumers inquire about the amount that the program is currently discounted. For example, the disclosure might state, “Ask us for the amount our adjustable rate mortgages are currently discounted.” In a transaction with a consumer buydown or with a third-party buydown that will be incorporated in the legal obligation, the creditor should disclose the program as a discounted variable-rate transaction, but need not disclose additional information regarding the buydown in its program disclosures. (See the commentary to §&#160;1026.19(b)(2)(viii) for a discussion of how to reflect the discount or premium in the historical example or the maximum rate and payment disclosure).</p>

If interest rate changes will be imposed more frequently or at different intervals than payment changes, a creditor must disclose the frequency and timing of both types of changes. For example, in a variable-rate transaction where interest rate changes are made monthly, but payment changes occur on an annual basis, this fact must be disclosed. In certain ARM transactions, the interval between loan closing and the initial adjustment is not known and may be different from the regular interval for adjustments. In such cases, the creditor may disclose the initial adjustment period as a range of the minimum and maximum amount of time from consummation or closing. For example, the creditor might state: “The first adjustment to your interest rate and payment will occur no sooner than 6 months and no later than 18 months after closing. Subsequent adjustments may occur once each year after the first adjustment.” (See comments 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-7 and 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)-4 for guidance on other disclosures when this alternative disclosure rule is used.)</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-vii-Interp-1" id="19-b-2-vii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Rate and payment caps.</strong> The creditor must disclose limits on changes (increases or decreases) in the interest rate or payment. If an initial discount is not taken into account in applying overall or periodic rate limitations, that fact must be disclosed. If separate overall or periodic limitations apply to interest rate increases resulting from other events, such as the exercise of a fixed-rate conversion option or leaving the creditor's employ, those limitations must also be stated. Limitations do not include legal limits in the nature of usury or rate ceilings under state or Federal statutes or regulations. (See §&#160;1026.30 for the rule requiring that a maximum interest rate be included in certain variable-rate transactions.) The creditor need not disclose each periodic or overall rate limitation that is currently available. As an alternative, the creditor may disclose the range of the lowest and highest periodic and overall rate limitations that may be applicable to the creditor's ARM transactions. For example, the creditor might state: “The limitation on increases to your interest rate at each adjustment will be set at an amount in the following range: Between 1 and 2 percentage points at each adjustment. The limitation on increases to your interest rate over the term of the loan will be set at an amount in the following range: Between 4 and 7 percentage points above the initial interest rate.” A creditor using this alternative rule must include a statement in its program disclosures suggesting that the consumer ask about the overall rate limitations currently offered for the creditor's ARM programs. (See comments 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-6 and 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)-3 for an explanation of the additional requirements for a creditor using this alternative rule for disclosure of periodic and overall rate limitations.)</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-vii-Interp-2" id="19-b-2-vii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Negative amortization and interest rate carryover.</strong> A creditor must disclose, where applicable, the possibility of negative amortization. For example, the disclosure might state, “If any of your payments is not sufficient to cover the interest due, the difference will be added to your loan amount.” Loans that provide for more than one way to trigger negative amortization are separate variable-rate programs requiring separate disclosures. (See the commentary to §&#160;1026.19(b)(2) for a discussion on the definition of a variable-rate loan program and the format for disclosure.) If a consumer is given the option to cap monthly payments that may result in negative amortization, the creditor must fully disclose the rules relating to the option, including the effects of exercising the option (such as negative amortization will occur and the principal loan balance will increase); however, the disclosure in §&#160;1026.19(b)(2)(viii) need not be provided.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-vii-Interp-3" id="19-b-2-vii-Interp-3">3. <strong>Conversion option.</strong> If a loan program permits consumers to convert their variable-rate loans to fixed-rate loans, the creditor must disclose that the interest rate may increase if the consumer converts the loan to a fixed-rate loan. The creditor must also disclose the rules relating to the conversion feature, such as the period during which the loan may be converted, that fees may be charged at conversion, and how the fixed rate will be determined. The creditor should identify any index or other measure or formula used to determine the fixed rate and state any margin to be added. In disclosing the period during which the loan may be converted and the margin, the creditor may use information applicable to the conversion feature during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures and state that the information is representative of conversion features recently offered by the creditor. The information may be used until the program disclosures are otherwise revised. Although the rules relating to the conversion option must be disclosed, the effect of exercising the option should not be reflected elsewhere in the disclosures, such as in the historical example or in the calculation of the initial and maximum interest rate and payments.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-vii-Interp-4" id="19-b-2-vii-Interp-4">4. <strong>Preferred-rate loans.</strong> Section 1026.19(b) applies to preferred-rate loans, where the rate will increase upon the occurrence of some event, such as an employee leaving the creditor's employ, whether or not the underlying rate is fixed or variable. In these transactions, the creditor must disclose the event that would allow the creditor to increase the rate such as that the rate may increase if the employee leaves the creditor's employ. The creditor must also disclose the rules relating to termination of the preferred rate, such as that fees may be charged when the rate is changed and how the new rate will be determined.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-1" id="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-1">1. <strong>Index movement.</strong> This section requires a creditor to provide an historical example, based on a $10,000 loan amount originating in 1977, showing how interest rate changes implemented according to the terms of the loan program would have affected payments and the loan balance at the end of each year during a 15-year period. (In all cases, the creditor need only calculate the payments and loan balance for the term of the loan. For example, in a five-year loan, a creditor would show the payments and loan balance for the five-year term, from 1977 to 1981, with a zero loan balance reflected for 1981. For the remaining ten years, 1982-1991, the creditor need only show the remaining index values, margin and interest rate and must continue to reflect all significant loan program terms such as rate limitations affecting them.) Pursuant to this section, the creditor must provide a history of index values for the preceding 15 years. Initially, the disclosures would give the index values from 1977 to the present. Each year thereafter, the revised program disclosures should include an additional year's index value until 15 years of values are shown. If the values for an index have not been available for 15 years, a creditor need only go back as far as the values are available in giving a history and payment example. In all cases, only one index value per year need be shown. Thus, in transactions where interest rate adjustments are implemented more frequently than once per year, a creditor may assume that the interest rate and payment resulting from the index value chosen will stay in effect for the entire year for purposes of calculating the loan balance as of the end of the year and for reflecting other loan program terms. In cases where interest rate changes are at the creditor's discretion (see the commentary to §&#160;1026.19(b)(2)(ii)), the creditor must provide a history of the rates imposed for the preceding 15 years, beginning with the rates in 1977. In giving this history, the creditor need only go back as far as the creditor's rates can reasonably be determined.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-2" id="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-2">2. <strong>Selection of index values.</strong> The historical example must reflect the method by which index values are determined under the program. If a creditor uses an average of index values or any other index formula, the history given should reflect those values. The creditor should select one date or, when an average of single values is used as an index, one period and should base the example on index values measured as of that same date or period for each year shown in the history. A date or period at any time during the year may be selected, but the same date or period must be used for each year in the historical example. For example, a creditor could use values for the first business day in July or for the first week ending in July for each of the 15 years shown in the example.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-3" id="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-3">3. <strong>Selection of margin.</strong> For purposes of the disclosure required under §&#160;1026.19(b)(2)(viii)(A), a creditor may select a representative margin that has been used during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures, and should disclose that the margin is one that the creditor has used recently. The margin selected may be used until a creditor revises the disclosure form.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-4" id="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-4">4. <strong>Amount of discount or premium.</strong> For purposes of the disclosure required under §&#160;1026.19(b)(2)(viii)(A), a creditor may select a discount or premium (amount and term) that has been used during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures, and should disclose that the discount or premium is one that the creditor has used recently. The discount or premium should be reflected in the historical example for as long as the discount or premium is in effect. A creditor may assume that a discount that would have been in effect for any part of a year was in effect for the full year for purposes of reflecting it in the historical example. For example, a 3-month discount may be treated as being in effect for the entire first year of the example; a 15-month discount may be treated as being in effect for the first two years of the example. In illustrating the effect of the discount or premium, creditors should adjust the value of the interest rate in the historical example, and should not adjust the margin or index values. For example, if during the six months preceding preparation of the disclosures the fully indexed rate would have been 10% but the first year's rate under the program was 8%, the creditor would discount the first interest rate in the historical example by 2 percentage points.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-5" id="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-5">5. <strong>Term of the loan.</strong> In calculating the payments and loan balances in the historical example, a creditor need not base the disclosures on each term to maturity or payment amortization that it offers. Instead, disclosures for ARMs may be based upon terms to maturity or payment amortizations of 5, 15 and 30 years, as follows: ARMs with terms or amortizations from over 1 year to 10 years may be based on a 5-year term or amortization; ARMs with terms or amortizations from over 10 years to 20 years may be based on a 15-year term or amortization; and ARMs with terms or amortizations over 20 years may be based on a 30-year term or amortization. Thus, disclosures for ARMs offered with any term from over 1 year to 40 years may be based solely on terms of 5, 15 and 30 years. Of course, a creditor may always base the disclosures on the actual terms or amortizations offered. If the creditor bases the disclosures on 5-, 15- or 30-year terms or payment amortization as provided above, the term or payment amortization used in making the disclosure must be stated.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-6" id="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-6">6. <strong>Rate caps.</strong> A creditor using the alternative rule described in comment 19(b)(2)(vii)-1 for disclosure of rate limitations must base the historical example upon the highest periodic and overall rate limitations disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(b)(2)(vii). In addition, the creditor must state the limitations used in the historical example. (See comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)-3 for an explanation of the use of the highest rate limitation in other disclosures.)</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-7" id="19-b-2-viii-A-Interp-7">7. <strong>Frequency of adjustments.</strong> In certain transactions, creditors may use the alternative rule described in comment 19(b)(2)(vi)-1 for disclosure of the frequency of rate and payment adjustments. In such cases, the creditor may assume for purposes of the historical example that the first adjustment occurred at the end of the first full year in which the adjustment could occur. For example, in an ARM in which the first adjustment may occur between 6 and 18 months after closing and annually thereafter, the creditor may assume that the first adjustment occurred at the end of the first year in the historical example. (See comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(B)-4 for an explanation of how to compute the maximum interest rate and payment when the initial adjustment period is not known.)</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-viii-B-Interp-1" id="19-b-2-viii-B-Interp-1">1. <strong>Initial and maximum interest rates and payments.</strong> The disclosure form must state the initial and maximum interest rates and payments for a $10,000 loan originated at an initial interest rate (index value plus margin adjusted by the amount of any discount or premium) in effect as of an identified month and year for the loan program disclosure. (See comment 19(b)(2)-5 on revisions to the loan program disclosure.) In calculating the maximum payment under this paragraph, a creditor should assume that the interest rate increases as rapidly as possible under the loan program, and the maximum payment disclosed should reflect the amortization of the loan during this period. Thus, in a loan with 2 percentage point annual (and 5 percentage point overall) interest rate limitations or “caps,” the maximum interest rate would be 5 percentage points higher than the initial interest rate disclosed. Moreover, the loan would not reach the maximum interest rate until the fourth year because of the 2 percentage point annual rate limitations, and the maximum payment disclosed would reflect the amortization of the loan during this period. If the loan program includes a discounted or premium initial interest rate, the initial interest rate should be adjusted by the amount of the discount or premium.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-viii-B-Interp-2" id="19-b-2-viii-B-Interp-2">2. <strong>Term of the loan.</strong> In calculating the initial and maximum payments, the creditor need not base the disclosures on each term to maturity or payment amortization offered under the program. Instead, the creditor may follow the rules set out in comment 19(b)(2)(viii)(A)-5. If a historical example is provided under §&#160;1026.19(b)(2)(viii)(A), the terms to maturity or payment amortization used in the historical example must be used in calculating the initial and maximum payment. In addition, creditors must state the term or payment amortization used in making the disclosures under this section.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-viii-B-Interp-3" id="19-b-2-viii-B-Interp-3">3. <strong>Rate caps.</strong> A creditor using the alternative rule for disclosure of interest rate limitations described in comment 19(b)(2)(vii)-1 must calculate the maximum interest rate and payment based upon the highest periodic and overall rate limitations disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(b)(2)(vii). In addition, the creditor must state the rate limitations used in calculating the maximum interest rate and payment.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-b-2-viii-B-Interp-4" id="19-b-2-viii-B-Interp-4">4. <strong>Frequency of adjustments.</strong> In certain transactions, a creditor may use the alternative rule for disclosure of the frequency of rate and payment adjustments described in comment 19(b)(2)(vi)-1. In such cases, the creditor must base the calculations of the initial and maximum rates and payments upon the earliest possible first adjustment disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(b)(2)(vi).

These disclosures must be provided in good faith. Except as otherwise provided in §&#160;1026.19(e), a disclosure is in good faith if it is consistent with §&#160;1026.17(c)(2)(i). Section 1026.17(c)(2)(i) provides that if any information necessary for an accurate disclosure is unknown to the creditor, the creditor shall make the disclosure based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure is provided to the consumer. The “reasonably available” standard requires that the creditor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining information. See comment 17(c)(2)(i)-1 for an explanation of the standard set forth in §&#160;1026.17(c)(2)(i). See comment 17(c)(2)(i)-2 for labeling disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e) that are estimates.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-ii-Interp-1" id="19-e-1-ii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Mortgage broker responsibilities.</strong> Section 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A) provides that if a mortgage broker receives a consumer's application, either the creditor or the mortgage broker must provide the consumer with the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) in accordance with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iii). Section 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A) also provides that if the mortgage broker provides the required disclosures, it must comply with all relevant requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e). This means that “mortgage broker” should be read in the place of “creditor” for all provisions of §&#160;1026.19(e), except to the extent that such a reading would create responsibility for mortgage brokers under §&#160;1026.19(f). To illustrate, §&#160;1026.19(e)(4)(i) states that if a creditor uses a revised estimate pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv) for the purpose of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), the creditor shall provide a revised version of the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) or the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) (including any corrected disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(i) or (ii)) reflecting the revised estimate. “Mortgage broker” could not be read in place of “creditor” in reference to the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i), (f)(2)(i), or (f)(2)(ii) because mortgage brokers are not responsible for the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i), (f)(2)(i), or (f)(2)(ii). In addition, §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(A) provides that the creditor must ensure that disclosures provided by mortgage brokers comply with all requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e), and that disclosures provided by mortgage brokers that do comply with all such requirements satisfy the creditor's obligation under §&#160;1026.19(e). The term “mortgage broker,” as used in §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(ii), has the same meaning as in §&#160;1026.36(a)(2). See also comment 36(a)-2. Section 1026.19(e)(1)(ii)(B) provides that if a mortgage broker provides any disclosure required under §&#160;1026.19(e), the mortgage broker must also comply with the requirements of §&#160;1026.25(c). For example, if a mortgage broker provides the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), it must maintain records for three years, in compliance with §&#160;1026.25(c)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-ii-Interp-2" id="19-e-1-ii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Creditor responsibilities.</strong> If a mortgage broker issues any disclosure required under §&#160;1026.19(e) in the creditor's place, the creditor remains responsible under §&#160;1026.19(e) for ensuring that the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e) have been satisfied. For example, if a mortgage broker receives a consumer's application and provides the consumer with the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), the creditor does not satisfy the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) if it provides duplicative disclosures to the consumer. In the same example, even if the broker provides an erroneous disclosure, the creditor is responsible and may not issue a revised disclosure correcting the error. The creditor is expected to maintain communication with the broker to ensure that the broker is acting in place of the creditor.</p>

        <div class="regdown-block level-4" data-label="19-e-1-iii-Interp" id="19-e-1-iii-Interp"></div>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-iii-Interp-1" id="19-e-1-iii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Timing and use of estimates.</strong> The disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) must be delivered not later than three business days after the creditor receives the consumer's application. For example, if an application is received on Monday, the creditor satisfies this requirement by either hand delivering the disclosures on or before Thursday, or placing them in the mail on or before Thursday, assuming each weekday is a business day. For purposes of §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iii)(A), the term “business day” means a day on which the creditor's offices are open to the public for carrying out substantially all of its business functions. <em>See</em> §&#160;1026.2(a)(6).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-iii-Interp-2" id="19-e-1-iii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Waiting period.</strong> The seven-business-day waiting period begins when the creditor delivers the disclosures or places them in the mail, not when the consumer receives or is considered to have received the disclosures. For example, if a creditor delivers the early disclosures to the consumer in person or places them in the mail on Monday, June 1, consummation may occur on or after Tuesday, June 9, the seventh business day following delivery or mailing of the early disclosures, because, for the purposes of §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iii)(B), Saturday is a business day, pursuant to §&#160;1026.2(a)(6).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-iii-Interp-3" id="19-e-1-iii-Interp-3">3. <strong>Denied or withdrawn applications.</strong> The creditor may determine within the three-business-day period that the application will not or cannot be approved on the terms requested, such as when a consumer's credit score is lower than the minimum score required for the terms the consumer applied for, or the consumer applies for a type or amount of credit that the creditor does not offer. In that case, or if the consumer withdraws the application within the three-business-day period by, for instance, informing the creditor that he intends to take out a loan from another creditor within the three-business-day period, the creditor need not make the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i). If the creditor fails to provide early disclosures and the transaction is later consummated on the terms originally applied for, then the creditor does not comply with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i). If, however, the consumer amends the application because of the creditor's unwillingness to approve it on the terms originally applied for, no violation occurs for not providing disclosures based on those original terms. But the amended application is a new application subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-iii-Interp-4" id="19-e-1-iii-Interp-4">4. <strong>Timeshares.</strong> If consummation occurs within three business days after a creditor's receipt of an application for a transaction that is secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan described in 11 U.S.C. 101(53D), a creditor complies with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iii) by providing the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) instead of the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-iii-Interp-5" id="19-e-1-iii-Interp-5">5. <strong>Multiple-advance construction loans.</strong> Section 1026.19(e)(1)(iii) generally requires a creditor to deliver the Loan Estimate or place it in the mail not later than the third business day after the creditor receives the consumer's application and not later than the seventh business day before consummation. When a multiple-advance loan to finance the construction of a dwelling may be permanently financed by the same creditor, §&#160;1026.17(c)(6)(ii) and comment 17(c)(6)-2 permit creditors to treat the construction phase and the permanent phase as either one transaction, with one combined disclosure, or more than one transaction, with a separate disclosure for each transaction. For construction - permanent transactions disclosed as one transaction, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iii) by delivering or placing in the mail one combined disclosure required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) not later than the third business day after the creditor receives an application and not later than the seventh business day before consummation. For construction - permanent transactions disclosed as a separate construction phase and a separate permanent phase for which an application for both the construction and permanent financing has been received, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iii) by delivering or placing in the mail the separate disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) for both the construction financing and the permanent financing not later than the third business day after the creditor receives the application and not later than the seventh business day before consummation. A creditor may also provide a separate disclosure required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) for the permanent phase before receiving an application for permanent financing at any time not later than the seventh business day before consummation. To illustrate:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-1-iii-Interp-5-i" id="19-e-1-iii-Interp-5-i">i. Assume a creditor receives a consumer's application for construction financing only on Monday, June 1. The creditor must deliver or place in the mail the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) for only the construction financing no later than Thursday, June 4, the third business day after the creditor received the consumer's application, and not later than the seventh business day before consummation of the transaction.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-1-iii-Interp-5-ii" id="19-e-1-iii-Interp-5-ii">ii. Assume the creditor receives a consumer's application for both construction and permanent financing on Monday, June 1. The creditor must deliver or place in the mail the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) for both the construction and permanent financing, disclosed as either one transaction or separate transactions, no later than Thursday, June 4, the third business day after the creditor received the consumer's application, and not later than the seventh business day before consummation of the transaction.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-1-iii-Interp-5-iii" id="19-e-1-iii-Interp-5-iii">iii. Assume the creditor receives a consumer's application for construction financing only on Monday, June 1. Assume further that the creditor receives the consumer's application for permanent financing on Monday, June 8. The creditor must deliver or place in the mail the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) for the construction financing no later than Thursday, June 4, the third business day after the creditor received the consumer's application for the construction financing only, and not later than the seventh business day before consummation of the construction transaction. The creditor must deliver or place in the mail the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) for the permanent financing no later than Thursday, June 11, the third business day after the creditor received the consumer's application for the permanent financing, and not later than the seventh business day before consummation of the permanent financing transaction.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-1-iii-Interp-5-iv" id="19-e-1-iii-Interp-5-iv">iv. Assume the same facts as in comment 19(e)(1)(iii)-5.ii, under which the creditor provides the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) for both construction financing and permanent financing. If the creditor generally conducts separate closings for the construction financing and the permanent financing or expects that the construction financing and the permanent financing may have separate closings, providing separate Loan Estimates for the construction financing and for the permanent financing allows the creditor to deliver separate Closing Disclosures for the separate phases. For example, assume further that the consumer has requested permanent financing after receiving separate Loan Estimates for the construction financing and for the permanent financing, that consummation of the construction financing is scheduled for July 1, and that consummation of the permanent financing is scheduled on or about June 1 of the following year. The creditor may provide the construction financing Closing Disclosure at least three business days before consummation of that transaction on July 1 and delay providing the permanent financing Closing Disclosure until three business days before consummation of that transaction on or about June 1 of the following year, in accordance with §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii). The creditor may also issue a revised Loan Estimate for the permanent financing at any time prior to 60 days before consummation, following the procedures under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(F).</p>

The creditor may, alternatively, rely on evidence that the consumer received the disclosures earlier than three business days. For example, if the creditor sends the disclosures via overnight mail on Monday, and the consumer signs for receipt of the overnight delivery on Tuesday, the creditor could demonstrate that the disclosures were received on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-iv-Interp-2" id="19-e-1-iv-Interp-2">2. <strong>Electronic delivery.</strong> The three-business-day period provided in §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iv) applies to methods of electronic delivery, such as email. For example, if a creditor sends the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e) via email on Monday, pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iv) the consumer is considered to have received the disclosures on Thursday, three business days later. The creditor may, alternatively, rely on evidence that the consumer received the emailed disclosures earlier. For example, if the creditor emails the disclosures at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, the consumer emails the creditor with an acknowledgement of receipt of the disclosures at 5 p.m. on the same day, the creditor could demonstrate that the disclosures were received on the same day. Creditors using electronic delivery methods, such as email, must also comply with §&#160;1026.37(o)(3)(iii), which provides that the disclosures in §&#160;1026.37 may be provided to the consumer in electronic form, subject to compliance with the consumer consent and other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act. For example, if a creditor delivers the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) to a consumer via email, but the creditor did not obtain the consumer's consent to receive disclosures via email prior to delivering the disclosures, then the creditor does not comply with §&#160;1026.37(o)(3)(iii), and the creditor does not comply with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), assuming the disclosures were not provided in a different manner in accordance with the timing requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iii).</p>

The consumer must have a bona fide personal financial emergency that necessitates consummating the credit transaction before the end of the waiting period. Whether these conditions are met is determined by the circumstances of the individual situation. The imminent sale of the consumer's home at foreclosure, where the foreclosure sale will proceed unless loan proceeds are made available to the consumer during the waiting period, is one example of a bona fide personal financial emergency. Each consumer who is primarily liable on the legal obligation must sign the written statement for the waiver to be effective.</p>

If on Monday, June 1, the consumer executes a waiver of the seven-business-day waiting period, the final disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) could then be delivered three business days before consummation, as required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii), on Tuesday, June 2, and the loan could be consummated on Friday, June 5.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-vi-Interp-1" id="19-e-1-vi-Interp-1">1. <strong>Permission to shop.</strong> Section 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A) permits creditors to impose reasonable requirements regarding the qualifications of the provider. For example, the creditor may require that a settlement agent chosen by the consumer must be appropriately licensed in the relevant jurisdiction. In contrast, a creditor does not permit a consumer to shop for purposes of §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi) if the creditor requires the consumer to choose a provider from a list provided by the creditor. Whether the creditor permits the consumer to shop consistent with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A) is determined based on all the relevant facts and circumstances. The requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(B) and (C) do not apply if the creditor does not permit the consumer to shop consistent with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-vi-Interp-2" id="19-e-1-vi-Interp-2">2. <strong>Disclosure of services for which the consumer may shop.</strong> If a creditor permits a consumer to shop for a settlement service, §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(B) requires the creditor to identify settlement services required by the creditor for which the consumer is permitted to shop in the disclosures provided pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i). See §&#160;1026.37(f)(3) regarding the content and format for disclosure of services required by the creditor for which the consumer is permitted to shop.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-vi-Interp-3" id="19-e-1-vi-Interp-3">3. <strong>Written list of providers.</strong> If the creditor permits the consumer to shop for a settlement service it requires, §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C) requires the creditor to provide the consumer with a written list identifying at least one available provider of that service and stating that the consumer may choose a different provider for that service. The settlement service providers identified on the written list required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C) must correspond to the required settlement services for which the consumer may shop, disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(f)(3). See form H-27 in appendix H to this part for a model list. Creditors using form H-27 in appendix H properly are deemed to be in compliance with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C). Creditors may make changes in the format or content of form H-27 in appendix H and be deemed to be in compliance with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C), so long as the changes do not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the form. An acceptable change to form H-27 in appendix H includes, for example, deleting the column for estimated fee amounts.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-vi-Interp-4" id="19-e-1-vi-Interp-4">4. <strong>Identification of available providers.</strong> Section 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C) provides that the creditor must identify settlement service providers, that are available to the consumer, for the settlement services that are required by the creditor for which a consumer is permitted to shop. A creditor does not comply with the identification requirement in §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C) unless it provides sufficient information to allow the consumer to contact the provider, such as the name under which the provider does business and the provider's address and telephone number. Similarly, a creditor does not comply with the availability requirement in §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C) if it provides a written list consisting of only settlement service providers that are no longer in business or that do not provide services where the consumer or property is located.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-vi-Interp-5" id="19-e-1-vi-Interp-5">5. <strong>Statement that consumer may choose different provider.</strong> Section 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C) requires the creditor to include on the written list a statement that the consumer may choose a provider that is not included on that list. <em>See</em> form H-27 of appendix H to this part for a model of such a statement.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-vi-Interp-6" id="19-e-1-vi-Interp-6">6. <strong>Additional information on written list.</strong> The creditor may include a statement on the written list that the listing of a settlement service provider does not constitute an endorsement of that service provider. The creditor may also identify on the written list providers of services for which the consumer is not permitted to shop, provided that the creditor clearly and conspicuously distinguishes those services from the services for which the consumer is permitted to shop. This may be accomplished by placing the services under different headings. For example, if the list provided pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C) identifies providers of pest inspections and surveys, but the consumer may select a provider, other than those identified on the list, for only the survey, then the list must specifically inform the consumer that the consumer is permitted to select a provider, other than a provider identified on the list, for only the survey.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-1-vi-Interp-7" id="19-e-1-vi-Interp-7">7. <strong>Relation to RESPA and Regulation X.</strong> Section 1026.19 does not prohibit creditors from including affiliates on the written list required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C). However, a creditor that includes affiliates on the written list must also comply with 12 CFR 1024.15. Furthermore, the written list is a “referral” under 12 CFR 1024.14(f).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-1" id="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-1">1. <strong>Fees restricted.</strong> A creditor or other person may not impose any fee, such as for an application, appraisal, or underwriting, until the consumer has received the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and indicated an intent to proceed with the transaction. The only exception to the fee restriction allows the creditor or other person to impose a bona fide and reasonable fee for obtaining a consumer's credit report, pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(2)(i)(B).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-2" id="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-2">2. <strong>Intent to proceed.</strong> Section 1026.19(e)(2)(i)(A) provides that a consumer may indicate an intent to proceed with a transaction in any manner the consumer chooses, unless a particular manner of communication is required by the creditor. The creditor must document this communication to satisfy the requirements of §&#160;1026.25. For example, oral communication in person immediately upon delivery of the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) is sufficiently indicative of intent. Oral communication over the phone, written communication via email, or signing a pre-printed form are also sufficiently indicative of intent if such actions occur after receipt of the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i). However, a consumer's silence is not indicative of intent because it cannot be documented to satisfy the requirements of §&#160;1026.25. For example, a creditor or third party may not deliver the disclosures, wait for some period of time for the consumer to respond, and then charge the consumer a fee for an appraisal if the consumer does not respond, even if the creditor or third party disclosed that it would do so.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-3" id="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-3">3. <strong>Timing of fees.</strong> At any time prior to delivery of the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), a creditor or other person may impose a credit report fee in connection with the consumer's application for a mortgage loan that is subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) as provided in §&#160;1026.19(e)(2)(i)(B). The consumer must have received the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and indicated an intent to proceed with the transaction described by those disclosures before paying or incurring any other fee imposed by a creditor or other person in connection with the consumer's application for a mortgage loan that is subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-4" id="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-4">4. <strong>Collection of fees.</strong> A creditor or other person complies with §&#160;1026.19(e)(2)(i)(A) if:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-4-i" id="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-4-i">i. A creditor receives a consumer's application directly from the consumer and does not impose any fee, other than a bona fide and reasonable fee for obtaining a consumer's credit report, until the consumer receives the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and indicates an intent to proceed with the transaction described by those disclosures.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-4-ii" id="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-4-ii">ii. A third party submits a consumer's application to a creditor and neither the creditor nor the third party imposes any fee, other than a bona fide and reasonable fee for obtaining a consumer's credit report, until the consumer receives the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and indicates an intent to proceed with the transaction described by those disclosures.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-4-iii" id="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-4-iii">iii. A third party submits a consumer's application to a creditor following a different creditor's denial of the consumer's application (or following the consumer's withdrawal of that application), and if a fee already has been assessed for obtaining the credit report, the new creditor or third party does not impose any additional fee until the consumer receives disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) from the new creditor and indicates an intent to proceed with the transaction described by those disclosures.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-5" id="19-e-2-i-A-Interp-5">5. <strong>Fees “imposed by” a person.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.19(e), a fee is “imposed by” a person if the person requires a consumer to provide a method for payment, even if the payment is not made at that time. For example, if a creditor or other person requires the consumer to provide a $500 check to pay for a “processing fee” before the consumer receives the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), the creditor or other person does not comply with §&#160;1026.19(e)(2)(i), even if the creditor or other person had stated that the check will not be cashed until after the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) are received by the consumer and waited until after the consumer subsequently indicated an intent to proceed to cash the check. Similarly, a creditor or other person does not comply with the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e)(2)(i) if the creditor or other person requires the consumer to provide a credit card number before the consumer receives the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), even if the creditor or other person had promised not to charge the consumer's credit card for the $500 processing fee until after the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) are received by the consumer and waited until after the consumer subsequently indicated an intent to proceed. In contrast, a creditor or other person complies with §&#160;1026.19(e)(2)(i) if the creditor or other person requires the consumer to provide a credit card number before the consumer receives the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and subsequently indicates an intent to proceed, provided that the consumer's authorization is only to pay for the cost of a credit report and the creditor or other person only charges a reasonable and bona fide fee for obtaining the consumer's credit report. This is so even if the creditor or other person maintains the consumer's credit card number on file and charges the consumer a $500 processing fee after the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) are received and the consumer subsequently indicates an intent to proceed with the transaction described by those disclosures, provided that the creditor or other person requested and received a separate authorization from the consumer for the processing fee after the consumer received the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and indicated an intent to proceed with the transaction described by those disclosures.</p>

For example, if the creditor provides a document showing the estimated monthly payment for a mortgage loan, and the estimate was based on the estimated loan amount and the consumer's estimated credit score, then the creditor must include the statement on the document. In contrast, if the creditor provides the consumer with a preprinted list of closing costs common in the consumer's area, the creditor need not include the statement. Similarly, the statement would not be required on a preprinted list of available rates for different loan products. This requirement does not apply to an advertisement, as defined in §&#160;1026.2(a)(2). Section 1026.19(e)(2)(ii) requires that the notice must be in a font size that is no smaller than 12-point font, and must state: “Your actual rate, payment, and costs could be higher. Get an official Loan Estimate before choosing a loan.” <em>See</em> form H-26 of appendix H to this part for a model statement.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-i-Interp-1" id="19-e-3-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>Requirement.</strong> Section 1026.19(e)(3)(i) provides the general rule that an estimated closing cost disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(e) is not in good faith if the charge paid by or imposed on the consumer exceeds the amount originally disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i). Although §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) and (iii) provide exceptions to the general rule, the charges that are generally subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-3-i-Interp-1-i" id="19-e-3-i-Interp-1-i">i. Fees paid to the creditor.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-3-i-Interp-1-ii" id="19-e-3-i-Interp-1-ii">ii. Fees paid to a mortgage broker.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-3-i-Interp-1-iii" id="19-e-3-i-Interp-1-iii">iii. Fees paid to an affiliate of the creditor or a mortgage broker.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-3-i-Interp-1-iv" id="19-e-3-i-Interp-1-iv">iv. Fees paid to an unaffiliated third party if the creditor did not permit the consumer to shop for a third party service provider for a settlement service.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-3-i-Interp-1-v" id="19-e-3-i-Interp-1-v">v. Transfer taxes.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-i-Interp-2" id="19-e-3-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>Charges “paid by or imposed on the consumer.”</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.19(e), a charge “paid by or imposed on the consumer” refers to the final amount for the charge paid by or imposed on the consumer at consummation or settlement, whichever is later. “Consummation” is defined in §&#160;1026.2(a)(13). “Settlement” is defined in Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.2(b). For example, at consummation, the consumer pays the creditor $100 for recording fees. Settlement of the transaction concludes five days after consummation, and the actual recording fees are $70. The creditor refunds the consumer $30 immediately after recording. The recording fee paid by the consumer is $70.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-i-Interp-3" id="19-e-3-i-Interp-3">3. <strong>Fees “paid to” a person.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.19(e), a fee is not considered “paid to” a person if the person does not retain the fee. For example, if a consumer pays the creditor transfer taxes and recording fees at the real estate closing and the creditor subsequently uses those funds to pay the county that imposed these charges, then the transfer taxes and recording fees are not “paid to” the creditor for purposes of §&#160;1026.19(e). Similarly, if a consumer pays the creditor an appraisal fee in advance of the real estate closing and the creditor subsequently uses those funds to pay another party for an appraisal, then the appraisal fee is not “paid to” the creditor for the purposes of §&#160;1026.19(e). A fee is also not considered “paid to” a person, for purposes of §&#160;1026.19(e), if the person retains the fee as reimbursement for an amount it has already paid to another party. If a creditor pays for an appraisal in advance of the real estate closing and the consumer pays the creditor an appraisal fee at the real estate closing, then the fee is not “paid to” the creditor for the purposes of §&#160;1026.19(e), even though the creditor retains the fee, because the payment is a reimbursement for an amount already paid.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-i-Interp-4" id="19-e-3-i-Interp-4">4. <strong>Transfer taxes and recording fees.</strong> See comments 37(g)(1)-1, -2, and -3 for a discussion of the difference between transfer taxes and recording fees.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-i-Interp-5" id="19-e-3-i-Interp-5">5. <strong>Lender credits.</strong> The disclosure of “lender credits,” as identified in §&#160;1026.37(g)(6)(ii), is required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i). “Lender credits,” as identified in §&#160;1026.37(g)(6)(ii), represents the sum of non-specific lender credits and specific lender credits. Non-specific lender credits are generalized payments from the creditor to the consumer that do not pay for a particular fee on the disclosures provided pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1). Specific lender credits are specific payments, such as a credit, rebate, or reimbursement, from a creditor to the consumer to pay for a specific fee. Non-specific lender credits and specific lender credits are negative charges to the consumer. The actual total amount of lender credits, whether specific or non-specific, provided by the creditor that is less than the estimated “lender credits” identified in §&#160;1026.37(g)(6)(ii) and disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e) is an increased charge to the consumer for purposes of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i). For example, if the creditor discloses a $750 estimate for “lender credits” pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e), but only $500 of lender credits is actually provided to the consumer, the creditor has not complied with §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) because the actual amount of lender credits provided is less than the estimated “lender credits” disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e), and is therefore, an increased charge to the consumer for purposes of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i). However, if the creditor discloses a $750 estimate for “lender credits” identified in §&#160;1026.37(g)(6)(ii) to cover the cost of a $750 appraisal fee, and the appraisal fee subsequently increases by $150, and the creditor increases the amount of the lender credit by $150 to pay for the increase, the credit is not being revised in a way that violates the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) because, although the credit increased from the amount disclosed, the amount paid by the consumer did not. However, if the creditor discloses a $750 estimate for “lender credits” to cover the cost of a $750 appraisal fee, but subsequently reduces the credit by $50 because the appraisal fee decreased by $50, then the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) have been violated because, although the amount of the appraisal fee decreased, the amount of the lender credit decreased. See also §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(D) and comment 19(e)(3)(iv)(D)-1 for a discussion of lender credits in the context of interest rate dependent charges.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-i-Interp-6" id="19-e-3-i-Interp-6">6. <strong>Good faith analysis for lender credits.</strong> For purposes of conducting the good faith analysis required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) for lender credits, the total amount of lender credits, whether specific or non-specific, actually provided to the consumer is compared to the amount of the “lender credits” identified in §&#160;1026.37(g)(6)(ii). The total amount of lender credits actually provided to the consumer is determined by aggregating the amount of the “lender credits” identified in §&#160;1026.38(h)(3) with the amounts paid by the creditor that are attributable to a specific loan cost or other cost, disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(f) and (g).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-i-Interp-7" id="19-e-3-i-Interp-7">7. <strong>Use of unrounded numbers.</strong> Sections 1026.37(o)(4) and 1026.38(t)(4) require that the dollar amounts of certain charges disclosed on the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure, respectively, to be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. However, to conduct the good faith analysis required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), the creditor should use unrounded numbers to compare the actual charge paid by or imposed on the consumer for a settlement service with the estimated cost of the service.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-ii-Interp-1" id="19-e-3-ii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Requirements.</strong> Section 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) provides that certain estimated charges are in good faith if the sum of all such charges paid by or imposed on the consumer does not exceed the sum of all such charges disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e) by more than 10 percent. Section 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) permits this limited increase for only the following items:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-3-ii-Interp-1-i" id="19-e-3-ii-Interp-1-i">i. Fees paid to an unaffiliated third party if the creditor permitted the consumer to shop for the third-party service, consistent with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-3-ii-Interp-1-ii" id="19-e-3-ii-Interp-1-ii">ii. Recording fees.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-ii-Interp-2" id="19-e-3-ii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Aggregate increase limited to ten percent.</strong> Under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(A), whether an individual estimated charge subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) is in good faith depends on whether the sum of all charges subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) increases by more than 10 percent, regardless of whether a particular charge increases by more than 10 percent. This is true even if an individual charge was omitted from the estimate provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and then imposed at consummation. The following examples illustrate the determination of good faith for charges subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii):</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-3-ii-Interp-2-i" id="19-e-3-ii-Interp-2-i">i. Assume that, in the disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), the creditor includes a $300 estimated fee for a settlement agent, the settlement agent fee is included in the category of charges subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii), and the sum of all charges subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) (including the settlement agent fee) equals $1,000. In this case, the creditor does not violate §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) if the actual settlement agent fee exceeds the estimated settlement agent fee by more than 10 percent (<strong>i.e.,</strong> the fee exceeds $330), provided that the sum of all such actual charges does not exceed the sum of all such estimated charges by more than 10 percent (<em>i.e.,</em> the sum of all such charges does not exceed $1,100).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-3-ii-Interp-2-ii" id="19-e-3-ii-Interp-2-ii">ii. Assume that, in the disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), the sum of all estimated charges subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) equals $1,000. If the creditor does not include an estimated charge for a notary fee but a $10 notary fee is charged to the consumer, and the notary fee is subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii), then the creditor does not violate §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) if the sum of all amounts charged to the consumer subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) does not exceed $1,100, even though an individual notary fee was not included in the estimated disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-ii-Interp-3" id="19-e-3-ii-Interp-3">3. <strong>Services for which the consumer may, but does not, select a settlement service provider.</strong> Good faith is determined pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii), instead of §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i), if the creditor permits the consumer to shop for a settlement service provider, consistent with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A). Section 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) provides that if the creditor requires a service in connection with the mortgage loan transaction, and permits the consumer to shop for that service consistent with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi), but the consumer either does not select a settlement service provider or chooses a settlement service provider identified by the creditor on the list, then good faith is determined pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii), instead of §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i). For example, if, in the disclosures provided pursuant to §§&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and 1026.37(f)(3), a creditor discloses an estimated fee for an unaffiliated settlement agent and permits the consumer to shop for that service, but the consumer either does not choose a provider, or chooses a provider identified by the creditor on the written list provided pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C), then the estimated settlement agent fee is included with the fees that may, in aggregate, increase by no more than 10 percent for the purposes of §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii). If, however, the consumer chooses a provider that is not on the written list, then good faith is determined according to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-ii-Interp-4" id="19-e-3-ii-Interp-4">4. <strong>Recording fees.</strong> Section 1026.19(e)(3)(ii) provides that an estimate of a charge for a third-party service or recording fees is in good faith if the conditions specified in §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) are satisfied. Recording fees are not charges for third-party services because recording fees are paid to the applicable government entity where the documents related to the mortgage transaction are recorded, and thus, the condition specified in §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(B) that the charge for third-party service not be paid to an affiliate of the creditor is inapplicable for recording fees. The condition specified in §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(C), that the creditor permits the consumer to shop for the third-party service, is similarly inapplicable. Therefore, estimates of recording fees need only satisfy the condition specified in §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii)(A) to meet the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-ii-Interp-5" id="19-e-3-ii-Interp-5">5. <strong>Calculating the aggregate amount of estimated charges.</strong> In calculating the aggregate amount of estimated charges for purposes of conducting the good faith analysis pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii), the aggregate amount of estimated charges must reflect charges for services that are actually performed. For example, assume that the creditor included a $100 estimated fee for a pest inspection in the disclosures provided pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), and the fee is included in the category of charges subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii), but a pest inspection was not obtained in connection with the transaction, then for purposes of the good faith analysis required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii), the sum of all charges subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) paid by or imposed on the consumer is compared to the sum of all such charges disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e), minus the $100 estimated pest inspection fee.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-ii-Interp-6" id="19-e-3-ii-Interp-6">6. <strong>Shopping for a third-party service.</strong> For good faith to be determined under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) a creditor must permit a consumer to shop consistent with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A). Section 1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A) provides that a creditor permits a consumer to shop for a settlement service if the creditor permits the consumer to select the provider of that service, subject to reasonable requirements. If the creditor permits the consumer to shop consistent with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A) good faith is determined under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii), unless the settlement service provider is the creditor or an affiliate of the creditor, in which case good faith is determined under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i). As noted in comment 19(e)(1)(vi)-1, whether the creditor permits the consumer to shop consistent with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A) is determined based on all the relevant facts and circumstances.</p>

Differences between the amounts of such charges disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the amounts of such charges paid by or imposed on the consumer do not constitute a lack of good faith, so long as the original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a particular service, was based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. This means that the estimate disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) was obtained by the creditor through due diligence, acting in good faith. <em>See</em> comments 17(c)(2)(i)-1 and 19(e)(1)(i)-1. For example, if the creditor requires homeowner's insurance but fails to include a homeowner's insurance premium on the estimates provided pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), then the creditor's failure to disclose does not comply with §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii). However, if the creditor does not require flood insurance and the subject property is located in an area where floods frequently occur, but not specifically located in a zone where flood insurance is required, failure to include flood insurance on the original estimates provided pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) does not constitute a lack of good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii). Or, if the creditor knows that the loan must close on the 15th of the month but estimates prepaid interest to be paid from the 30th of that month, then the under-disclosure does not comply with §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii). If, however, the creditor estimates consistent with the best information reasonably available that the loan will close on the 30th of the month and bases the estimate of prepaid interest accordingly, but the loan actually closed on the 1st of the next month instead, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-iii-Interp-2" id="19-e-3-iii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Good faith requirement for required services chosen by the consumer.</strong> If a service is required by the creditor, the creditor permits the consumer to shop for that service consistent with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A), the creditor provides the list required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C), and the consumer chooses a service provider that is not on that list to perform that service, then the actual amounts of such fees need not be compared to the original estimates for such fees to perform the good faith analysis required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) or (ii). Differences between the amounts of such charges disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the amounts of such charges paid by or imposed on the consumer do not constitute a lack of good faith, so long as the original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a particular service, was based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. For example, if the consumer informs the creditor that the consumer will choose a settlement agent not identified by the creditor on the written list provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C), and the creditor discloses an unreasonably low estimated settlement agent fee of $20 when the average prices for settlement agent fees in that area are $150, then the under-disclosure does not comply with §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii) and good faith is determined under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i). If the creditor permits the consumer to shop consistent with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A) but fails to provide the written list required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(C), good faith is determined under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) instead of §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii) unless the settlement service provider is the creditor or an affiliate of the creditor in which case good faith is determined under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i). As noted in comment 19(e)(1)(vi)-1 whether the creditor permits the consumer to shop consistent with §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(vi)(A) is determined based on all the relevant facts and circumstances.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-iii-Interp-3" id="19-e-3-iii-Interp-3">3. <strong>Good faith requirement for property taxes or non-required services chosen by the consumer.</strong> Differences between the amounts of estimated charges for property taxes or services not required by the creditor disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the amounts of such charges paid by or imposed on the consumer do not constitute a lack of good faith, so long as the original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a particular service, was based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. For example, if the consumer informs the creditor that the consumer will obtain a type of inspection not required by the creditor, the creditor must include the charge for that item in the disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), but the actual amount of the inspection fee need not be compared to the original estimate for the inspection fee to perform the good faith analysis required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii). The original estimated charge, or lack of an estimated charge for a particular service, complies with §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii) if it is made based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time that the estimate was provided. But, for example, if the subject property is located in a jurisdiction where consumers are customarily represented at closing by their own attorney, even though it is not a requirement, and the creditor fails to include a fee for the consumer's attorney, or includes an unreasonably low estimate for such fee, on the original estimates provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), then the creditor's failure to disclose, or unreasonably low estimation, does not comply with §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii). Similarly, the amount disclosed for property taxes must be based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure was provided. For example, if the creditor fails to include a charge for property taxes, or includes an unreasonably low estimate for that charge, on the original estimates provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), then the creditor's failure to disclose, or unreasonably low estimation, does not comply with §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii) and the charge for property tax would be subject to the good faith determination under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i).</p>

Section 1026.19(e)(3)(iii) provides that an estimate of the charges listed in §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii) is in good faith if it is consistent with the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure is provided and that good faith is determined under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii) even if such charges are paid to the creditor or affiliates of the creditor, so long as the charges are bona fide. For determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), to be bona fide, charges must be lawful and for services that are actually performed.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-iv-Interp-1" id="19-e-3-iv-Interp-1">1. <strong>Requirement.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), good faith is determined by calculating the difference between the estimated charges originally provided pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the actual charges paid by or imposed on the consumer. Section 1026.19(e)(3)(iv) provides the exception to this rule. Pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv), for purposes of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), the creditor may use a revised estimate of a charge instead of the amount originally disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) if the revision is due to one of the reasons set forth in §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) through (F).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-iv-Interp-2" id="19-e-3-iv-Interp-2">2. <strong>Actual increase.</strong> A creditor may determine good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii) based on the increased charges reflected on revised disclosures only to the extent that the reason for revision, as identified in §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) through (F), actually increased the particular charge. For example, if a consumer requests a rate lock extension, then the revised disclosures on which a creditor relies for purposes of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) may reflect a new rate lock extension fee, but the fee may be no more than the rate lock extension fee charged by the creditor in its usual course of business, and the creditor may not rely on changes to other charges unrelated to the rate lock extension for purposes of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-iv-Interp-3" id="19-e-3-iv-Interp-3">3. <strong>Documentation requirement.</strong> In order to comply with §&#160;1026.25, creditors must retain records demonstrating compliance with the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e). For example, if revised disclosures are provided because of a changed circumstance under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) affecting settlement costs, the creditor must be able to show compliance with §&#160;1026.19(e) by documenting the original estimate of the cost at issue, explaining the reason for revision and how it affected settlement costs, showing that the corrected disclosure increased the estimate only to the extent that the reason for revision actually increased the cost, and showing that the timing requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e)(4) were satisfied. However, the documentation requirement does not require separate corrected disclosures for each change. A creditor may provide corrected disclosures reflecting multiple changed circumstances, provided that the creditor's documentation demonstrates that each correction complies with the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-iv-Interp-4" id="19-e-3-iv-Interp-4">4. <strong>Revised disclosures for general informational purposes.</strong> Section 1026.19(e)(3)(iv) does not prohibit the creditor from issuing revised disclosures for informational purposes, <em>e.g.,</em> to keep the consumer apprised of updated information, even if the revised disclosures may not be used for purposes of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii). See comment 19(e)(3)(iv)(A)-1.ii for an example in which the creditor issues revised disclosures even though the sum of all costs subject to the 10 percent tolerance category has not increased by more than 10 percent.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-iv-Interp-5" id="19-e-3-iv-Interp-5">5. <strong>Best information reasonably available.</strong> Regardless of whether a creditor may use particular disclosures for purposes of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), except as otherwise provided in §&#160;1026.19(e), any disclosures must be based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time they are provided to the consumer. <em>See</em> §&#160;1026.17(c)(2)(i) and comment 17(c)(2)(i)-1. For example, if the creditor issues revised disclosures reflecting a new rate lock extension fee for purposes of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i), other charges unrelated to the rate lock extension must be reflected on the revised disclosures based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the revised disclosures are provided. Nonetheless, any increases in those other charges unrelated to the rate lock extension may not be used for the purposes of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-3-iv-A-Interp-1-i" id="19-e-3-iv-A-Interp-1-i">i. <strong>Charges subject to the zero percent tolerance category.</strong> Assume a creditor provides a $200 estimated appraisal fee pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), which will be paid to an affiliated appraiser and therefore may not increase for purposes of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i), except as provided in §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv). The estimate was based on information provided by the consumer at application, which included information indicating that the subject property was a single-family dwelling. Upon arrival at the subject property, the appraiser discovers that the property is actually a single-family dwelling located on a farm. A different schedule of appraisal fees applies to residences located on farms. A changed circumstance has occurred (<em>i.e.,</em> information provided by the consumer is found to be inaccurate after the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) were provided), which caused an increase in the cost of the appraisal. Therefore, if the creditor issues revised disclosures with the corrected appraisal fee, the actual appraisal fee of $400 paid at the real estate closing by the consumer will be compared to the revised appraisal fee of $400 to determine if the actual fee has increased above the estimated fee. However, if the creditor failed to provide revised disclosures, then the actual appraisal fee of $400 must be compared to the originally disclosed estimated appraisal fee of $200.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-3-iv-A-Interp-1-ii" id="19-e-3-iv-A-Interp-1-ii">ii. <strong>Charges subject to the ten percent tolerance category.</strong> Assume a creditor provides a $400 estimate of title fees, which are included in the category of fees which may not increase by more than 10 percent for the purposes of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii), except as provided in §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv). An unreleased lien is discovered and the title company must perform additional work to release the lien. However, the additional costs amount to only a five percent increase over the sum of all fees included in the category of fees which may not increase by more than 10 percent. A changed circumstance has occurred (<em>i.e.,</em> new information), but the sum of all costs subject to the 10 percent tolerance category has not increased by more than 10 percent. Section 1026.19(e)(3)(iv) does not prohibit the creditor from issuing revised disclosures, but if the creditor issues revised disclosures in this scenario, when the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) are delivered, the actual title fees of $500 may not be compared to the revised title fees of $500; they must be compared to the originally estimated title fees of $400 because the changed circumstance did not cause the sum of all costs subject to the 10 percent tolerance category to increase by more than 10 percent.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-iv-A-Interp-2" id="19-e-3-iv-A-Interp-2">2. <strong>Changed circumstance.</strong> A changed circumstance may be an extraordinary event beyond the control of any interested party. For example, a war or a natural disaster would be an extraordinary event beyond the control of an interested party. A changed circumstance may also be an unexpected event specific to the consumer or the transaction. For example, if the creditor provided an estimate of title insurance on the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), but the title insurer goes out of business during underwriting, then this unexpected event specific to the transaction is a changed circumstance. A changed circumstance may also be information specific to the consumer or transaction that the creditor relied upon when providing the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and that was inaccurate or changed after the disclosures were provided. For example, if the creditor relied on the consumer's income when providing the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), and the consumer represented to the creditor that the consumer had an annual income of $90,000, but underwriting determines that the consumer's annual income is only $80,000, then this inaccuracy in information relied upon is a changed circumstance. Or, assume two co-applicants applied for a mortgage loan. One applicant's income was $30,000, while the other applicant's income was $50,000. If the creditor relied on the combined income of $80,000 when providing the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), but the applicant earning $30,000 becomes unemployed during underwriting, thereby reducing the combined income to $50,000, then this change in information relied upon is a changed circumstance. A changed circumstance may also be the discovery of new information specific to the consumer or transaction that the creditor did not rely on when providing the original disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i). For example, if the creditor relied upon the value of the property in providing the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), but during underwriting a neighbor of the seller, upon learning of the impending sale of the property, files a claim contesting the boundary of the property to be sold, then this new information specific to the transaction is a changed circumstance.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-iv-A-Interp-3" id="19-e-3-iv-A-Interp-3">3. <strong>Six pieces of information presumed collected, but not required.</strong> Section 1026.19(e)(1)(iii) requires creditors to deliver the disclosures not later than the third business day after the creditor receives the consumer's application, which consists of the six pieces of information identified in §&#160;1026.2(a)(3)(ii). A creditor is not required to collect the consumer's name, monthly income, social security number to obtain a credit report, the property address, an estimate of the value of the property, or the mortgage loan amount sought. However, for purposes of determining whether an estimate is provided in good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), a creditor is presumed to have collected these six pieces of information. For example, if a creditor provides the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) prior to receiving the property address from the consumer, the creditor cannot subsequently claim that the receipt of the property address is a changed circumstance pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) or (B).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-iv-B-Interp-1" id="19-e-3-iv-B-Interp-1">1. <strong>Requirement.</strong> If changed circumstances cause a change in the consumer's eligibility for specific loan terms disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and revised disclosures are provided because the change in eligibility resulted in increased cost for a settlement service beyond the applicable tolerance threshold, the charge paid by or imposed on the consumer for the settlement service for which cost increased due to the change in eligibility is compared to the revised estimated cost for the settlement service to determine if the actual fee has increased above the estimated fee. For example, assume that, prior to providing the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), the creditor believed that the consumer was eligible for a loan program that did not require an appraisal. The creditor then provides the estimated disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), which do not include an estimated charge for an appraisal. During underwriting it is discovered that the consumer was delinquent on mortgage loan payments in the past, making the consumer ineligible for the loan program originally identified on the estimated disclosures, but the consumer remains eligible for a different program that requires an appraisal. If the creditor provides revised disclosures reflecting the new program and including the appraisal fee, then the actual appraisal fee will be compared to the appraisal fee included in the revised disclosures to determine if the actual fee has increased above the estimated fee. However, if the revised disclosures also include increased estimates for title fees, the actual title fees must be compared to the original estimates assuming that the increased title fees do not stem from the change in eligibility or any other change warranting a revised disclosure. See also §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) and comment 19(e)(3)(iv)(A)-2 regarding the definition of changed circumstances.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-3-iv-D-Interp-1-i" id="19-e-3-iv-D-Interp-1-i">i. Assume a creditor sets the interest rate by executing a rate lock agreement with the consumer.

If the consumer enters into a rate lock agreement with the creditor after the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) were provided, then §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(D) requires the creditor to provide, no later than three business days after the date that the consumer and the creditor enter into a rate lock agreement, a revised version of the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) reflecting the revised interest rate, the points disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(f)(1), lender credits, and any other interest rate dependent charges and terms. Provided that the revised version of the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) reflect any revised points disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(f)(1) and lender credits, the actual points and lender credits are compared to the revised points and lender credits for the purpose of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i).</p>

Section 1026.19(e)(4)(ii) prohibits a creditor from providing a revised version of the Loan Estimate as required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) on or after the date on which the creditor provides the Closing Disclosure as required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i). If the interest rate is locked on or after the date on which the creditor provides the Closing Disclosure and the Closing Disclosure is inaccurate as a result, then the creditor must provide the consumer a corrected Closing Disclosure, at or before consummation, reflecting any changed terms, pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(f)(2). If the rate lock causes the Closing Disclosure to become inaccurate before consummation in a manner listed in §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(ii), the creditor must ensure that the consumer receives a corrected Closing Disclosure no later than three business days before consummation, as provided in that paragraph.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-iv-E-Interp-1" id="19-e-3-iv-E-Interp-1">1. <strong>Requirements.</strong> If the consumer indicates an intent to proceed with the transaction more than 10 business days after the disclosures were originally provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iii), for the purpose of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), a creditor may use a revised estimate of a charge instead of the amount originally disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i). Section 1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(E) requires no justification for the change to the original estimate other than the lapse of 10 business days. For example, assume a creditor includes a $500 underwriting fee on the disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) and the creditor delivers those disclosures on a Monday. If the consumer indicates intent to proceed 11 business days later, the creditor may provide new disclosures with a $700 underwriting fee. In this example, §&#160;1026.19(e) and §&#160;1026.25 require the creditor to document that a new disclosure was provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(E) but do not require the creditor to document a reason for the increase in the underwriting fee.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-3-iv-E-Interp-2" id="19-e-3-iv-E-Interp-2">2. <strong>Longer time period.</strong> For transactions in which the interest rate is locked for a specific period of time, §&#160;1026.37(a)(13)(ii) requires the creditor to provide the date and time (including the applicable time zone) when that period ends. If the creditor establishes a period greater than 10 business days after the disclosures were originally provided (or subsequently extends it to such a longer period) before the estimated closing costs expire, notwithstanding the 10-business-day period discussed in comment 19(e)(3)(iv)(E)-1, that longer time period becomes the relevant time period for purposes of §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(E). Accordingly, in such a case, the creditor may not issue revised disclosures for purposes of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii) under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(E) until after the longer time period has expired. A creditor establishes such a period greater than 10 business days by communicating the greater time period to the consumer, including through oral communication.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-e-4-i-Interp-1" id="19-e-4-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>Three-business-day requirement.</strong> Section 1026.19(e)(4)(i) provides that, subject to the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e)(4)(ii), if a creditor uses a revised estimate pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv) for the purpose of determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), the creditor shall provide a revised version of the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) or the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) (including any corrected disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(i) or (ii)) reflecting the revised estimate within three business days of receiving information sufficient to establish that one of the reasons for revision provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A) through (F) has occurred. The following examples illustrate these requirements:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-4-i-Interp-1-i" id="19-e-4-i-Interp-1-i">i. Assume a creditor requires a pest inspection. The unaffiliated pest inspection company informs the creditor on Monday that the subject property contains evidence of termite damage, requiring a further inspection, the cost of which will cause an increase in estimated settlement charges subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) by more than 10 percent. The creditor must provide revised disclosures by Thursday to comply with §&#160;1026.19(e)(4)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-4-i-Interp-1-ii" id="19-e-4-i-Interp-1-ii">ii. Assume a creditor receives information on Monday that, because of a changed circumstance under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A), the title fees will increase by an amount totaling six percent of the originally estimated settlement charges subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii). The creditor had received information three weeks before that, because of a changed circumstance under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(A), the pest inspection fees increased by an amount totaling five percent of the originally estimated settlement charges subject to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii). Thus, on Monday, the creditor has received sufficient information to establish a valid reason for revision and must provide revised disclosures reflecting the 11 percent increase by Thursday to comply with §&#160;1026.19(e)(4)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-e-4-i-Interp-1-iii" id="19-e-4-i-Interp-1-iii">iii. Assume a creditor requires an appraisal. The creditor receives the appraisal report, which indicates that the value of the home is significantly lower than expected. However, the creditor has reason to doubt the validity of the appraisal report. A reason for revision has not been established because the creditor reasonably believes that the appraisal report is incorrect. The creditor then chooses to send a different appraiser for a second opinion, but the second appraiser returns a similar report. At this point, the creditor has received information sufficient to establish that a reason for revision has, in fact, occurred, and must provide corrected disclosures within three business days of receiving the second appraisal report. In this example, in order to comply with §§&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv) and 1026.25, the creditor must maintain records documenting the creditor's doubts regarding the validity of the appraisal to demonstrate that the reason for revision did not occur upon receipt of the first appraisal report.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-1-i-Interp-1" id="19-f-1-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>Requirements.</strong> Section 1026.19(f)(1)(i) requires disclosure of the actual terms of the credit transaction, and the actual costs associated with the settlement of that transaction, for closed-end credit transactions that are secured by real property or a cooperative unit, other than reverse mortgages subject to §&#160;1026.33. For example, if the creditor requires the consumer to pay money into a reserve account for the future payment of taxes, the creditor must disclose to the consumer the exact amount that the consumer is required to pay into the reserve account. If the disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) do not contain the actual terms of the transaction, the creditor does not violate §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) if the creditor provides corrected disclosures that contain the actual terms of the transaction and complies with the other requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f), including the timing requirements in §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii) and (f)(2). For example, if the creditor provides the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) on Monday, June 1, but the consumer adds a mobile notary service to the terms of the transaction on Tuesday, June 2, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) if it provides disclosures reflecting the revised terms of the transaction on or after Tuesday, June 2, assuming that the corrected disclosures are also provided at or before consummation, under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-1-i-Interp-2" id="19-f-1-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>Best information reasonably available.</strong> Creditors may estimate disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) and (f)(2)(ii) using the best information reasonably available when the actual term is unknown to the creditor at the time disclosures are made, consistent with §&#160;1026.17(c)(2)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-f-1-i-Interp-2-i" id="19-f-1-i-Interp-2-i">i. <strong>Actual term unknown.</strong> An actual term is unknown if it is not reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosures are made. The “reasonably available” standard requires that the creditor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining the information. For example, the creditor must at a minimum utilize generally accepted calculation tools, but need not invest in the most sophisticated computer program to make a particular type of calculation. The creditor normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information. For example, the creditor might look to the consumer for the time of consummation, to insurance companies for the cost of insurance, to realtors for taxes and escrow fees, or to a settlement agent for homeowner's association dues or other information in connection with a real estate settlement. The following examples illustrate the reasonably available standard for purposes of §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-f-1-i-Interp-2-i-A" id="19-f-1-i-Interp-2-i-A">A. Assume a creditor provides the disclosure under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) for a transaction in which the title insurance company that is providing the title insurance policies is acting as the settlement agent in connection with the transaction, but the creditor does not request the actual cost of the lender's title insurance policy that the consumer is purchasing from the title insurance company and instead discloses an estimate based on information from a different transaction. The creditor has not exercised due diligence in obtaining the information about the cost of the lender's title insurance policy required under the “reasonably available” standard in connection with the estimate disclosed for the lender's title insurance policy.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-f-1-i-Interp-2-i-B" id="19-f-1-i-Interp-2-i-B">B. Assume that in the prior example the creditor obtained information about the terms of the consumer's transaction from the settlement agent regarding the amounts disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(j) and (k). The creditor has exercised due diligence in obtaining the information about the costs under §&#160;1026.38(j) and (k) for purposes of the “reasonably available” standard in connection with such disclosures under §&#160;1026.38(j) and (k).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-f-1-i-Interp-2-ii" id="19-f-1-i-Interp-2-ii">ii. <strong>Estimates.</strong> If an actual term is unknown, the creditor may utilize estimates using the best information reasonably available in making disclosures even though the creditor knows that more precise information will be available at or before consummation. However, the creditor may not utilize an estimate without exercising due diligence to obtain the actual term for the consumer's transaction. <em>See</em> comment 19(f)(1)(i)-2.i. The creditor is required to provide corrected disclosures containing the actual terms of the transaction at or before consummation under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2), subject to the exceptions provided for in that paragraph. Disclosures under §&#160;1026.19(f) are subject to the labeling rules set forth in §&#160;1026.38. See comment 17(c)(2)(i)-2 for guidance on labeling estimates.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-f-1-i-Interp-2-iii" id="19-f-1-i-Interp-2-iii">iii. <strong>Settlement agent.</strong> If a settlement agent provides disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) three business days before consummation pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(v), the “best information reasonably available” standard applies to terms for which the actual term is unknown to the settlement agent at the time the disclosures are provided. The settlement agent normally may rely on the representations of other parties in obtaining information, but if information about actual terms is not reasonably available, the settlement agent also must satisfy the “best information reasonably available” standard. Accordingly, the settlement agent is required to exercise due diligence to obtain information if it is providing the Closing Disclosure pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(v). For example, for the loan terms table required to be disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(b), the settlement agent would be considered to have exercised due diligence if it obtained such information from the creditor. Because the creditor remains responsible under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(v) for ensuring that the Closing Disclosure is provided in accordance with §&#160;1026.19(f), the creditor is expected to maintain communication with the settlement agent to ensure that the settlement agent is acting in place of the creditor. See comment 19(f)(1)(v)-3 for guidance on a creditor's responsibilities where a settlement agent provides disclosures.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-1-i-Interp-3" id="19-f-1-i-Interp-3">3. <strong>Denied or withdrawn applications.</strong> The creditor is not required to provide the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) if, before the time the creditor is required to provide the disclosures under §&#160;1026.19(f), the creditor determines the consumer's application will not or cannot be approved on the terms requested, or the consumer has withdrawn the application, and, as such, the transaction will not be consummated. For transactions covered by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i), the creditor may rely on comment 19(e)(1)(iii)-3 in determining that disclosures are not required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) because the consumer's application will not or cannot be approved on the terms requested or the consumer has withdrawn the application.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-1-ii-Interp-1" id="19-f-1-ii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Timing.</strong> Except as provided in §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B), (f)(2)(i), (f)(2)(iii), (f)(2)(iv), and (f)(2)(v), the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) must be received by the consumer no later than three business days before consummation. For example, if consummation is scheduled for Thursday, the creditor satisfies this requirement by hand delivering the disclosures on Monday, assuming each weekday is a business day. For purposes of §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii), the term “business day” means all calendar days except Sundays and legal public holidays referred to in §&#160;1026.2(a)(6). <em>See</em> comment 2(a)(6)-2.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-1-ii-Interp-2" id="19-f-1-ii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Receipt of disclosures three business days before consummation.</strong> Section 1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) provides that the consumer must receive the disclosures no later than three business days before consummation. To comply with this requirement, the creditor must arrange for delivery accordingly. Section 1026.19(f)(1)(iii) provides that, if any disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) are not provided to the consumer in person, the consumer is considered to have received the disclosures three business days after they are delivered or placed in the mail. Thus, for example, if consummation is scheduled for Thursday, a creditor would satisfy the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) if the creditor places the disclosures in the mail on Thursday of the previous week, because, for the purposes of §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii), Saturday is a business day, pursuant to §&#160;1026.2(a)(6), and, pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(iii), the consumer would be considered to have received the disclosures on the Monday before consummation is scheduled. <em>See</em> comment 19(f)(1)(iii)-1. A creditor would not satisfy the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) in this example if the creditor places the disclosures in the mail on the Monday before consummation. However, the creditor in this example could satisfy the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) by delivering the disclosures on Monday, for instance, by way of electronic mail, provided the requirements of §&#160;1026.38(t)(3)(iii) relating to disclosures in electronic form are satisfied and assuming that each weekday is a business day, and provided that the creditor obtains evidence that the consumer received the emailed disclosures on Monday. <em>See</em> comment 19(f)(1)(iii)-2.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-1-ii-Interp-3" id="19-f-1-ii-Interp-3">3. <strong>Timeshares.</strong> For transactions secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan described in 11 U.S.C. 101(53D), §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B) requires a creditor to ensure that the consumer receives the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) no later than consummation. Timeshare transactions covered by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B) may be consummated at the time or any time after the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) are received by the consumer. For example, if a consumer provides the creditor with an application, as defined by §&#160;1026.2(a)(3), for a mortgage loan secured by a timeshare on Monday, June 1, and consummation of the timeshare transaction is scheduled for Friday, June 5, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B) by ensuring that the consumer receives the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) no later than consummation on Friday, June 5. If a consumer provides the creditor with an application for a mortgage loan secured by a timeshare on Monday, June 1 and consummation of the timeshare transaction is scheduled for Tuesday, June 2, then the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(B) by ensuring that the consumer receives the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) no later than consummation on Tuesday, June 2. In some cases, a Loan Estimate must be provided under §&#160;1026.19(e) before provision of the Closing Disclosure. See comment 19(e)(1)(iii)-4 for guidance on providing the Loan Estimate for transactions secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan.</p>

If the creditor delivers the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) in person, consummation may occur any time on the third business day following delivery. If the creditor provides the disclosures by mail, the consumer is considered to have received them three business days after they are placed in the mail, for purposes of determining when the three-business-day waiting period required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) begins. The creditor may, alternatively, rely on evidence that the consumer received the disclosures earlier than three business days after mailing. See comment 19(e)(1)(iv)-1 for an example in which the creditor sends disclosures via overnight mail.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-1-iii-Interp-2" id="19-f-1-iii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Other forms of delivery.</strong> Creditors that use electronic mail or a courier other than the United States Postal Service also may follow the approach for disclosures provided by mail described in comment 19(f)(1)(iii)-1. For example, if a creditor sends a disclosure required under §&#160;1026.19(f) via email on Monday, pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(iii) the consumer is considered to have received the disclosure on Thursday, three business days later. The creditor may, alternatively, rely on evidence that the consumer received the emailed disclosures earlier after delivery. See comment 19(e)(1)(iv)-2 for an example in which the creditor emails disclosures and receives an acknowledgment from the consumer on the same day. Creditors using electronic delivery methods, such as email, must also comply with §&#160;1026.38(t)(3)(iii). For example, if a creditor delivers the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) to a consumer via email, but the creditor did not obtain the consumer's consent to receive disclosures via email prior to delivering the disclosures, then the creditor does not comply with §&#160;1026.38(t)(3)(iii), and the creditor does not comply with §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i), assuming the disclosures were not provided in a different manner in accordance with the timing requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii).</p>

The consumer must have a bona fide personal financial emergency that necessitates consummating the credit transaction before the end of the waiting period. Whether these conditions are met is determined by the facts surrounding individual situations. The imminent sale of the consumer's home at foreclosure, where the foreclosure sale will proceed unless loan proceeds are made available to the consumer during the waiting period, is one example of a bona fide personal financial emergency. Each consumer who is primarily liable on the legal obligation must sign the written statement for the waiver to be effective.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-1-v-Interp-1" id="19-f-1-v-Interp-1">1. <strong>Requirements.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.19(f), a settlement agent is the person conducting the settlement. A settlement agent may provide the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) instead of the creditor. By assuming this responsibility, the settlement agent becomes responsible for complying with all of the relevant requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f), meaning that “settlement agent” should be read in the place of “creditor” for all the relevant provisions of §&#160;1026.19(f), except where such a reading would create responsibility for settlement agents under §&#160;1026.19(e). For example, comment 19(f)(1)(ii)-3 explains that, in some cases involving transactions secured by a consumer's interest in a timeshare plan, a Loan Estimate must be provided under §&#160;1026.19(e). “Settlement agent” could not be read in place of “creditor” in comment 19(f)(1)(ii)-3 because settlement agents are not responsible for the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i). To ensure timely and accurate compliance with the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(v), the creditor and settlement agent need to communicate effectively.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-1-v-Interp-2" id="19-f-1-v-Interp-2">2. <strong>Settlement agent responsibilities.</strong> If a settlement agent provides any disclosure under §&#160;1026.19(f), the settlement agent must comply with the relevant requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f). For example, if the creditor and settlement agent agree that the creditor will deliver the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) to be received by the consumer three business days before consummation, pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A), and that the settlement agent will deliver any corrected disclosures at or before consummation, including disclosures provided so that they are received by the consumer three business days before consummation under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(ii), and will permit the consumer to inspect the disclosures during the business day before consummation, the settlement agent must ensure that the consumer receives the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) at or before consummation and is able to inspect the disclosures during the business day before consummation, if the consumer so requests, in accordance with §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(i). See comment 19(f)(1)(v)-3 below for additional guidance regarding the creditor's responsibilities where the settlement agent provides disclosures. The settlement agent may assume the responsibility to provide some or all of the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f). See comment 19(f)(1)(v)-4 for guidance on how creditors and settlement agents may divide responsibilities for completing the disclosures.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-1-v-Interp-3" id="19-f-1-v-Interp-3">3. <strong>Creditor responsibilities.</strong> If a settlement agent provides disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f) in the creditor's place, the creditor remains responsible under §&#160;1026.19(f) for ensuring that the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f) have been satisfied. For example, if the settlement agent assumes the responsibility for providing all of the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i), the creditor does not comply with §&#160;1026.19(f) if the settlement agent does not provide these disclosures at all, or if the consumer receives the disclosures later than three business days before consummation, as required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii)(A) and, as applicable, (f)(2)(ii). The creditor does not satisfy the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f) if it provides duplicative disclosures. For example, a creditor does not satisfy its obligation by issuing disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f) that mirror ones already issued by the settlement agent for the purpose of demonstrating that the consumer received timely disclosures. The creditor is expected to maintain communication with the settlement agent to ensure that the settlement agent is acting in place of the creditor. Disclosures provided by a settlement agent in accordance with §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(v) satisfy the creditor's obligation under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-1-v-Interp-4" id="19-f-1-v-Interp-4">4. <strong>Shared responsibilities permitted - completing the disclosures.</strong> Creditors and settlement agents may agree to divide responsibility with respect to completing any of the disclosures under §&#160;1026.38 for the disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i). The settlement agent may assume the responsibility to complete some or all of the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f). For example, the creditor complies with the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) and the settlement agent complies with the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(v) if the settlement agent agrees to complete only the portion of the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) related to closing costs for taxes, title fees, and insurance premiums, and the creditor agrees to complete the remainder of the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i), and either the settlement agent or the creditor provides the consumer with one single disclosure form containing all of the information required to be disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i), in accordance with the other requirements in §&#160;1026.19(f), such as requirements related to timing and delivery.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-2-i-Interp-1" id="19-f-2-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>Requirements.</strong> Under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(i), if the disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) become inaccurate before consummation, other than as provided under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(ii), the creditor shall provide corrected disclosures reflecting any changed terms to the consumer so that the consumer receives the corrected disclosures at or before consummation. The creditor need not comply with the timing requirements in §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(ii) if an event other than one identified in §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(ii) occurs, and such changes occur after the creditor provides the consumer with the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i). For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-f-2-i-Interp-1-i" id="19-f-2-i-Interp-1-i">i. Assume consummation is scheduled for Thursday, the consumer received the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) on Monday, and a walk-through inspection occurs on Wednesday morning. During the walk-through the consumer discovers damage to the dishwasher. The seller agrees to credit the consumer $500 towards a new dishwasher. The creditor complies with the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f) if the creditor provides corrected disclosures so that the consumer receives them at or before consummation on Thursday.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-f-2-i-Interp-1-ii" id="19-f-2-i-Interp-1-ii">ii. Assume consummation is scheduled for Friday and on Monday morning the creditor sends the disclosures via overnight delivery to the consumer, ensuring that the consumer receives the disclosures on Tuesday. On Monday night, the seller agrees to sell certain household furnishings to the consumer for an additional $1,000, to be paid at the real estate closing, and the consumer immediately informs the creditor of the change. The creditor must provide corrected disclosures so that the consumer receives them at or before consummation. The creditor does not violate §&#160;1026.19(f) because the change to the transaction resulting from negotiations between the seller and consumer occurred after the creditor provided the final disclosures, regardless of the fact that the change occurred before the consumer had received the final disclosures.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-f-2-i-Interp-1-iii" id="19-f-2-i-Interp-1-iii">iii. Assume consummation is scheduled for Thursday, the consumer received the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) on Monday, and a walk-through inspection occurs on Wednesday morning. As a result of consumer and seller negotiations, the total amount due from the buyer increases by $500. Also on Wednesday, the creditor discovers that the homeowner's insurance premium that was disclosed as $800 is actually $850. The new $500 amount due and the $50 insurance premium understatements are not violations of §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i), and the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) by providing corrected disclosures reflecting the $550 increase so that the consumer receives them at or before consummation, pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(ii).</p>

Requirements for annual percentage rate disclosures are set forth in §&#160;1026.38(o)(4), and requirements determining whether an annual percentage rate is accurate are set forth in §&#160;1026.22. Requirements for loan product disclosures are set forth in §&#160;1026.38(a)(5)(iii) and §&#160;1026.37(a)(10). Requirements for prepayment penalty disclosures are set forth in §&#160;1026.38(b) and §&#160;1026.37(b)(4).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-i" id="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-i">i. <strong>Example - APR becomes inaccurate.</strong> Assume consummation is scheduled for Thursday, June 11 and the disclosure for a regular mortgage transaction received by the consumer on Monday, June 8 under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) discloses an annual percentage rate of 7.00 percent:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-i-A" id="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-i-A">A. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.10 percent. The creditor is not required to delay consummation to provide corrected disclosures under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(ii) because the annual percentage rate is accurate pursuant to §&#160;1026.22, but the creditor is required under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(i) to provide corrected disclosures, including any other changed terms, so that the consumer receives them on or before Thursday, June 11.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-i-B" id="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-i-B">B. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.15 percent and corrected disclosures were not received by the consumer on or before Monday, June 8 because the annual percentage rate is inaccurate pursuant to §&#160;1026.22. The creditor is required to delay consummation and provide corrected disclosures, including any other changed terms, so that the consumer receives them at least three business days before consummation under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(ii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-ii" id="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-ii">ii. <strong>Example - loan product changes.</strong> Assume consummation is scheduled for Thursday, June 11 and the disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) disclose a product required to be disclosed as a “Fixed Rate” that contains no features that may change the periodic payment.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-ii-A" id="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-ii-A">A. On Thursday, June 11, the loan product required to be disclosed changes to a “5/1 Adjustable Rate.” The creditor is required to provide corrected disclosures and delay consummation until the consumer has received the corrected disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) reflecting the change in the product disclosure, and any other changed terms, at least three business days before consummation. If, after the corrected disclosures in this example are provided, the loan product subsequently changes before consummation to a “3/1 Adjustable Rate,” the creditor is required to provide additional corrected disclosures and again delay consummation until the consumer has received the corrected disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) reflecting the change in the product disclosure, and any other changed terms, at least three business days before consummation.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-ii-B" id="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-ii-B">B. On Thursday, June 11, the loan product required to be disclosed has changed to a “Fixed Rate” with a “Negative Amortization” feature. The creditor is required to provide corrected disclosures and delay consummation until the consumer has received the corrected disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) reflecting the change in the product disclosure, and any other changed terms, at least three business days before consummation.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-iii" id="19-f-2-ii-Interp-1-iii">iii. <strong>Example - prepayment penalty is added.</strong> Assume consummation is scheduled for Thursday, June 11 and the disclosure provided under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) did not disclose a prepayment penalty. On Wednesday, June 10, a prepayment penalty is added to the transaction such that the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.38(b) becomes inaccurate. The creditor is required to provide corrected disclosures and delay consummation until the consumer has received the corrected disclosures provided under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) reflecting the change in the disclosure of the loan terms, and any other changed terms, at least three business days before consummation. If, after the revised disclosures in this example are provided but before consummation, the prepayment penalty is removed such that the description of the prepayment penalty again becomes inaccurate, and no other changes to the transaction occur, the creditor is required to provide corrected disclosures so that the consumer receives them at or before consummation under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(i), but the creditor is not required to delay consummation because §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(ii)(C) applies only when a prepayment penalty is added.</p>

The creditor learns on Monday, November 4 that the transfer taxes owed to the State differ from those previously disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i), resulting in an increase in the amount actually paid by the consumer. The creditor complies with §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) and §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(iii) by revising the disclosures accordingly and delivering or placing them in the mail no later than 30 days after Monday, November 4. Assume further that the increase in transfer taxes paid by the consumer also exceeds the amount originally disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i) above the limitations prescribed by §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i).

Because the $500 assessment does not result in a change to an amount actually paid by the consumer, the creditor is not required to provide a corrected disclosure pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(iii). However, the assessment will result in a change to an amount actually paid by the seller from the amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(f)(4)(i). Pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(f)(4)(ii), the settlement agent must deliver or place in the mail corrected disclosures to the seller no later than 30 days after Tuesday and provide a copy to the creditor pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(f)(4)(iv).</p>

Assume consummation occurs on a Monday and the security instrument is recorded on Tuesday, the day after consummation. Assume further that ten days after consummation the municipality in which the property is located raises property tax rates effective after the date on which settlement concludes. Section 1026.19(f)(2)(iii) does not require the creditor to provide the consumer with corrected disclosures because the increase in property tax rates is not in connection with the settlement of the transaction.</p>

A creditor is not required to provide corrected disclosures under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(iii) if the only changes that would be required to be disclosed in the corrected disclosure are changes to per-diem interest and any disclosures affected by the change in per-diem interest, even if the amount of per-diem interest actually paid by the consumer differs from the amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(g)(2) and (o). Nonetheless, if a creditor is providing a corrected disclosure under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(iii) for reasons other than changes in per-diem interest and the per-diem interest has changed as well, the creditor must disclose in the corrected disclosures under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(iii) the correct amount of the per-diem interest and provide corrected disclosures for any disclosures that are affected by the change in per-diem interest.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-f-3-ii-Interp-2-i" id="19-f-3-ii-Interp-2-i">i. Assume a creditor defines a geographic area that contains two subdivisions, one with a median appraisal cost of $200, and the other with a median appraisal cost of $1,000. This geographic area would not satisfy the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f)(3)(ii) because the cost characteristics of the two populations are dissimilar. However, a geographic area would be appropriately defined if both subdivisions had a relatively normal distribution of appraisal costs, even if the distribution for each subdivision ranges from below $200 to above $1,000.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-f-3-ii-Interp-2-ii" id="19-f-3-ii-Interp-2-ii">ii. Assume a creditor defines a type of loan that includes two distinct rate products. The median recording fee for one product is $80, while the median recording fee for the other product is $130. This definition of loan type would not satisfy the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f)(3)(ii) because the cost characteristics of the two products are dissimilar. However, a type of loan would be appropriately defined if both products had a relatively normal distribution of recording fees, even if the distribution for each product ranges from below $80 to above $130.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-3-ii-Interp-3" id="19-f-3-ii-Interp-3">3. <strong>Uniform use.</strong> If a creditor chooses to use an average charge for a settlement service for a particular loan within a class, §&#160;1026.19(f)(3)(ii)(C) requires the creditor to use that average charge for that service on all loans within the class. For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-f-3-ii-Interp-3-i" id="19-f-3-ii-Interp-3-i">i. Assume a creditor elects to use an average charge for appraisal fees. The creditor defines a class of transactions as all fixed rate loans originated between January 1 and April 30 secured by real property or a cooperative unit located within a particular metropolitan statistical area. The creditor must then charge the average appraisal charge to all consumers obtaining fixed rate loans originated between May 1 and August 30 secured by real property or a cooperative unit located within the same metropolitan statistical area.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="19-f-3-ii-Interp-3-ii" id="19-f-3-ii-Interp-3-ii">ii. The example in paragraph i of this comment assumes that a consumer would not be required to pay the average appraisal charge unless an appraisal was required on that particular loan. Using the example above, if a consumer applies for a loan within the defined class, but already has an appraisal report acceptable to the creditor from a prior loan application, the creditor may not charge the consumer the average appraisal fee because an acceptable appraisal report has already been obtained for the consumer's application. Similarly, although the creditor defined the class broadly to include all fixed rate loans, the creditor may not require the consumer to pay the average appraisal charge if the particular fixed rate loan program the consumer applied for does not require an appraisal.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-3-ii-Interp-4" id="19-f-3-ii-Interp-4">4. <strong>Average amount paid.</strong> The average charge must correspond to the average amount paid by or imposed on consumers and sellers during the prior defined time period. For example, assume a creditor calculates an average tax certification fee based on four-month periods starting January 1 of each year. The tax certification fees charged to a consumer on May 20 may not exceed the average tax certification fee paid from January 1 through April 30. A creditor may delay the period by a reasonable amount of time if such delay is needed to perform the necessary analysis and update the affected systems, provided that each subsequent period is scheduled accordingly. For example, a creditor may define a four-month period from January 1 to April 30 and begin using the average charge from that period on May 15, provided the average charge is used until September 15, at which time the average charge for the period from May 1 to August 31 becomes effective.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-3-ii-Interp-5" id="19-f-3-ii-Interp-5">5. <strong>Adjustments based on retrospective analysis required.</strong> Creditors using average charges must ensure that the total amount paid by or imposed on consumers for a service does not exceed the total amount paid to the providers of that service for the particular class of transactions. A creditor may find that, even though it developed an average-cost pricing program in accordance with the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f)(3)(ii), over time it has collected more from consumers than it has paid to settlement service providers. For example, assume a creditor defines a class of transactions and uses that class to develop an average charge of $135 for pest inspections. The creditor then charges $135 per transaction for 100 transactions from January 1 through April 30, but the actual average cost to the creditor of pest inspections during this period is $115. The creditor then decreases the average charge for the May to August period to account for the lower average cost during the January to April period. At this point, the creditor has collected $2,000 more than it has paid to settlement service providers for pest inspections. The creditor then charges $115 per transaction for 70 transactions from May 1 to August 30, but the actual average cost to the creditor of pest inspections during this period is $125. Based on the average cost to the creditor from the May to August period, the average charge to the consumer for the September to December period should be $125. However, while the creditor spent $700 more than it collected during the May to August period, it collected $1,300 more than it spent from January to August. In cases such as these, the creditor remains responsible for ensuring that the amount collected from consumers does not exceed the total amounts paid for the corresponding settlement services over time. The creditor may develop a variety of methods that achieve this outcome. For example, the creditor may choose to refund the proportional overage paid to the affected consumers. Or the creditor may choose to factor in the excess amount collected to decrease the average charge for an upcoming period. Although any method may comply with this requirement, a creditor is deemed to have complied if it defines a six-month time period and establishes a rolling monthly period of reevaluation. For example, assume a creditor defines a six-month time period from January 1 to June 30 and the creditor uses the average charge starting July 1. If, at the end of July, the creditor recalculates the average cost from February 1 to July 31, and then uses the recalculated average cost for transactions starting August 1, the creditor complies with the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f)(3)(ii), even if the creditor actually collected more from consumers than was paid to providers over time.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-3-ii-Interp-6" id="19-f-3-ii-Interp-6">6. <strong>Adjustments based on prospective analysis permitted, but not required.</strong> A creditor may prospectively adjust average charges if it develops a statistically reliable and accurate method for doing so. For example, assume a creditor calculates average charges based on two time periods: winter (October 1 to March 31), and summer (April 1 to September 30). If the creditor can demonstrate that the average cost of a particular settlement service is always at least 15 percent more expensive during the winter period than the summer period, the creditor may increase the average charge for the next winter period by 15 percent over the average cost for the current summer period, provided, however, that the creditor performs retrospective periodic adjustments, as explained in comment 19(f)(3)(ii)-5.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-3-ii-Interp-7" id="19-f-3-ii-Interp-7">7. <strong>Charges that vary with loan amount or property value.</strong> An average charge may not be used for any charge that varies according to the loan amount or property value. For example, an average charge may not be used for a transfer tax if the transfer tax is calculated as a percentage of the loan amount or property value. Average charges also may not be used for any insurance premium. For example, average charges may not be used for title insurance or for either the upfront premium or initial escrow deposit for hazard insurance.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-3-ii-Interp-8" id="19-f-3-ii-Interp-8">8. <strong>Prohibited by law.</strong> An average charge may not be used where prohibited by any applicable State or local law. For example, a creditor may not impose an average charge for an appraisal if applicable law prohibits creditors from collecting any amount in excess of the actual cost of the appraisal.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="19-f-3-ii-Interp-9" id="19-f-3-ii-Interp-9">9. <strong>Documentation required.</strong> To comply with §&#160;1026.25, a creditor must retain all documentation used to calculate the average charge for a particular class of transactions for at least three years after any settlement for which that average charge was used. The documentation must support the components and methods of calculation. For example, if a creditor calculates an average charge for a particular county recording fee by simply averaging all of the relevant fees paid in the prior month, the creditor need only retain the receipts for the individual recording fees, a ledger demonstrating that the total amount received did not exceed the total amount paid over time, and a document detailing the calculation. However, if a creditor develops complex algorithms for determining averages, not only must the creditor maintain the underlying receipts and ledgers, but the creditor must maintain documentation sufficiently detailed to allow an examiner to verify the accuracy of the calculations.</p>

Until the Bureau issues a version of the special information booklet relating to the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure under §§&#160;1026.37 and 1026.38, for applications that are received on or after October 3, 2015, a creditor may change the title appearing on the cover of the version of the special information booklet in use before October 3, 2015, provided the words “settlement costs” are used in the title. See comment 1(d)(5)-1 for guidance regarding compliance with §&#160;1026.19(g) for applications received on or after October 3, 2015.</p>

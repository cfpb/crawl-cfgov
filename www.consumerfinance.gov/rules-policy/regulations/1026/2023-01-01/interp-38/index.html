<h3>Content of disclosures</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-aa-Interp-1" id="38-aa-Interp-1"><strong>1. Disclosures not applicable.</strong> Where a disclosure is not applicable to a particular transaction, form H-25 of appendix H to this part may not be modified to state “not applicable” or “N/A.” The portion of the form pertaining to the inapplicable disclosure may be left blank unless otherwise provided by §&#160;1026.38. For example, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.38(r) of the consumer's or seller's real estate broker may be left blank for a transaction that does not involve real estate brokers, such as a refinance or home equity loan. As provided in §&#160;1026.38(m) and (n), however, the adjustable payment and adjustable interest rate tables required by those paragraphs may be included only if those disclosures are applicable to the transaction and otherwise must be excluded.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-aa-Interp-2" id="38-aa-Interp-2"><strong>2. Format.</strong> See §&#160;1026.38(t) and its commentary for guidance on the proper format to be used in making the disclosures, as well as required and permissible modifications.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-aa-Interp-3" id="38-aa-Interp-3"><strong>3. Good faith requirement.</strong> The disclosures required by §&#160;1026.38 are required to reflect the actual terms of the legal obligation between the parties, and the actual costs associated with the settlement of the transaction. Creditors and settlement agents may estimate disclosures as provided pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(i) when the actual term or cost is unknown at the time the disclosures are made. <em>See</em> §§&#160;1026.17(c)(2) and 1026.19(f)(1)(i) and comments 17(c)(2)(i)-1 and -2, and 19(f)(1)(i)-2.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-aa-Interp-4" id="38-aa-Interp-4"><strong>4. Reductions in principal balance.</strong> A principal reduction that occurs immediately or very soon after closing must be disclosed in the summaries of transactions table on the standard Closing Disclosure pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(v) or in the payoffs and payments table on the alternative Closing Disclosure pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B). The disclosure of a principal reduction under §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(v) or (t)(5)(vii)(B) includes the following elements: (1) The amount of the principal reduction; (2) the phrase “principal reduction” or a similar phrase; (3) for a principal reduction disclosure under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) only, the name of the payee; (4) if applicable to the transaction, the phrase “Paid Outside of Closing” or “P.O.C.” and the name of the party making the payment; and (5) if the principal reduction is used to satisfy the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(v), a statement that the principal reduction is being provided to offset charges that exceed the legal limits, using any language that meets the clear and conspicuous standard under §&#160;1026.38(t)(1)(i). If a creditor is required to disclose the name of the party making the payment or that the principal reduction is being provided to offset charges that exceed the legal limits, and there is insufficient space under the §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(v) or (t)(5)(vii)(B) disclosure for these elements of the principal reduction disclosure, the creditor may omit these elements from the §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(v) or (t)(5)(vii)(B) disclosure. If the creditor omits these elements from the §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(v) or (t)(5)(vii)(B) disclosure, the creditor must provide a complete principal reduction disclosure under an appropriate heading on an additional page, in accordance with §&#160;1026.38(j) and (t)(5)(ix), as applicable, with a reference to the abbreviated principal reduction disclosure under §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(v) or (t)(5)(vii)(B).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-aa-Interp-4-i" id="38-aa-Interp-4-i">i. <strong>Principal reduction not paid with closing funds.</strong> A principal reduction is disclosed in the summaries of transactions table under §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(v) and marked with the phrase “Paid Outside of Closing” or the abbreviation “P.O.C.” pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(j)(4)(i), or in the payoffs and payments table under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) marked with the phrase “Paid Outside of Closing” or the abbreviation “P.O.C.,” if it is not paid from closing funds. For a principal reduction disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(v) that is not paid from closing funds, the amount of the principal reduction is not included in computing the summaries of transactions totals under §&#160;1026.38(j) or the cash to close disclosures under §&#160;1026.38(i). For a principal reduction disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) that is not paid from closing funds, the amount of the principal reduction is not included in computing the total payoffs and payments amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) or the cash to close amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(e)(5)(ii). For example, a creditor providing a $500 principal reduction to satisfy the refund requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(v) discloses the principal reduction under §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(v) by providing in Section K of the summaries of transactions table a statement such as “$500.00 Principal Reduction for exceeding legal limits P.O.C. Lender,” and not including the amount of the principal reduction in the summaries of transactions totals under §&#160;1026.38(j) or the calculating cash to close disclosures under §&#160;1026.38(i). Alternatively, if there is insufficient space under §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(v) for a creditor to disclose the name of the party making the payment or a statement that the principal reduction is being provided to offset charges that exceed the legal limits, a creditor may disclose a statement such as “$500.00 Principal Reduction P.O.C.” under §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(v) and a statement on an additional page such as “$500.00 Principal Reduction for exceeding legal limits P.O.C. Lender. See Section K on page 3.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-aa-Interp-4-ii" id="38-aa-Interp-4-ii">ii. <strong>Principal reduction paid with closing funds.</strong> A principal reduction is disclosed in the summaries of transactions table under §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(v) or in the payoffs and payments table under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) without the phrase “Paid Outside of Closing” or the abbreviation “P.O.C.” if it is paid from closing funds. The amount of a principal reduction that is paid with closing funds is included in the applicable calculations required under §&#160;1026.38. For example, in a refinance transaction using the alternative tables on the Closing Disclosure, a creditor discloses a $1,000 principal reduction to reduce the cash provided to the consumer by providing in the payoffs and payments table under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) a statement such as “Principal Reduction to Consumer” under the column heading “TO” and “$1,000.00” under the column heading “AMOUNT,” and by including such amount in the total payoffs and payments amount under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) and in the cash to close amount under §&#160;1026.38(e)(5)(ii). In this example, the creditor must disclose the following elements under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B): The amount of the principal reduction, the phrase “principal reduction” or a similar phrase, and the name of the payee. The creditor should not include in the disclosure the phrase “Paid Outside of Closing” or “P.O.C.” and the name of the party making the payment, or a statement that the principal reduction is being provided to offset charges that exceed the legal limits, because those principal reduction disclosure elements are not applicable to the transaction in this particular example. The creditor may not use an addendum for the principal reduction disclosure in this example.</p>

To comply with this requirement, the creditor discloses the value determined by the appraisal or valuation used to determine approval of the credit transaction. If the creditor has not obtained an appraisal, the creditor may disclose the estimated value of the property. Where an estimate is disclosed, rather than an appraisal, the label for the disclosure is changed to “Estimated Prop. Value.” The creditor may use the estimate provided by the consumer at application but, if it has performed its own estimate of the property value for purposes of approving the credit transaction by the time the disclosure is provided to the consumer, the creditor must disclose the estimate it used for purposes of approving the credit transaction. For transactions involving construction where there is no seller, the creditor must disclose the value of the property that is used to determine the approval of the credit transaction, including improvements to be made on the property if those improvements are used in determining the approval of the credit transaction.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-d-2-Interp-1" id="38-d-2-Interp-1">1. <strong>Required use.</strong> The disclosure of the alternative cash to close table in §&#160;1026.38(d)(2) may only be provided by a creditor in a transaction without a seller or for a simultaneous subordinate financing transaction. In a purchase transaction, the alternative disclosure may be used for the simultaneous subordinate financing Closing Disclosure only if the first-lien Closing Disclosure records the entirety of the seller's transaction. The use of this alternative table for transactions without a seller or for simultaneous subordinate financing transactions is required if the Loan Estimate provided to the consumer disclosed the optional alternative table under §&#160;1026.37(d)(2) and must be used in conjunction with the use of the alternative calculating cash to close disclosure under §&#160;1026.38(e). See comments 38(j)-3 and 38(k)(2)(vii)-1 for disclosure requirements applicable to the first-lien transaction when the alternative disclosures are used for a simultaneous subordinate financing transaction and a seller contributes to the costs of the subordinate financing. See also comments 38(t)(5)(vii)(B)-1 and -2 for the requirement to disclose the seller's contributions, if any, toward the subordinate financing in the payoffs and payments table on the simultaneous subordinate financing Closing Disclosure.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-d-2-Interp-2" id="38-d-2-Interp-2">2. <strong>Method of indication.</strong> The indication of whether the cash is either due from or payable to the consumer is made by the use of check boxes as shown in form H-25(J) of appendix H to this part. Forms H-25(E) and H-25(G) of appendix H to this part contain examples of the use of these checkboxes.</p>

<h3>38(e) Alternative calculating cash to close table for transactions without a seller or for simultaneous subordinate financing.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-e-Interp-1" id="38-e-Interp-1">1. <strong>Required use.</strong> The disclosure of the table in §&#160;1026.38(e) may only be provided by a creditor in a transaction without a seller or for a simultaneous subordinate financing transaction. In a purchase transaction, the alternative disclosure may be used for the simultaneous subordinate financing Closing Disclosure only if the first-lien Closing Disclosure records the entirety of the seller's transaction. The use of this alternative calculating cash to close table for transactions without a seller or for simultaneous subordinate financing is required for transactions in which the Loan Estimate provided to the consumer disclosed the optional alternative table under §&#160;1026.37(h)(2), and must be used in conjunction with the alternative disclosure under §&#160;1026.38(d)(2).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-e-Interp-2" id="38-e-Interp-2">2. <strong>More prominent disclosures.</strong> Section 1026.38(e)(1)(iii), (2)(iii), (3)(iii), and (4)(iii) requires that statements are given as to whether the “Final” amount disclosed under each subparagraph (ii) of §&#160;1026.38(e)(1) through (e)(4) is different than or equal to, and in some cases whether the amount is greater than or less than, the corresponding “Loan Estimate” amount disclosed under each subparagraph (i) of §&#160;1026.38(e)(1) through (e)(4). These statements are more prominent than the other disclosures under §&#160;1026.38(e). The statement of whether the estimated and final amounts are different, stated as a “Yes” or “No” in capital letters and in boldface, under the subheading “Did this change?,” as shown on forms H-25(E) and H-25(G) of appendix H to this part, complies with the requirement to state whether the amounts are different more prominently. Such statement of “No” satisfies the requirement to state that the estimated and final amounts are equal, and these sections do not provide for any narrative text to be included with such statement. The prominence requirement also requires that, in the event an increase or decrease in costs has occurred, certain words within the narrative text to be included under the subheading “Did this change?” for a “Yes” answer are displayed more prominently than other disclosures. For example, under §&#160;1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A), this more prominent statement could take the form of the phrases “Total Loan Costs (D)” and “Total Other Costs (I)” being shown in boldface, as shown on forms H-25(E) and H-25(G) of appendix H to this part. See comment 38(e)-4 for further guidance regarding the prominence of such statements.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-e-Interp-3" id="38-e-Interp-3">3. <strong>Statements of differences.</strong> The dollar amounts disclosed under §&#160;1026.38 generally are shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. <em>See</em> comment 38(t)(4)-1. Any amount in the “Final” column of the alternative calculating cash to close table under §&#160;1026.38(e) is shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. Pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C), however, any amount in the “Loan Estimate” column of the alternative calculating cash to close table under §&#160;1026.38(e) is rounded to the nearest dollar amount to match the corresponding estimated amount disclosed on the Loan Estimate's calculating cash to close table under §&#160;1026.37(h). For purposes of §&#160;1026.38(e)(1)(iii), (2)(iii), and (4)(iii), each statement of a change between the amounts disclosed on the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure is based on the actual, non-rounded estimate that would have been disclosed on the Loan Estimate under §&#160;1026.37(h) if it had been shown to two decimal places rather than a whole dollar amount. For example, if the amounts in the “Loan Estimate” column of the total closing costs row disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(e)(2)(i) is $12,500, but the non-rounded estimate of total closing costs is $12,500.35, and the “Final” column of the total closing costs row disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(e)(2)(ii) is $12,500.35, then, even though the table would appear to show a $0.35 increase in total closing costs, no statement of such increase is given under §&#160;1026.38(e)(2)(iii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-e-Interp-4" id="38-e-Interp-4">4. <strong>Statements that the consumer should see details.</strong> The provisions of §&#160;1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A) and (e)(4)(iii)(A) each require a statement that the consumer should see certain details of the closing costs disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(f), (g), or (t). Forms H-25(E) and H-25(G) of appendix H to this part contain examples of these statements. For example, §&#160;1026.38(e)(4)(iii)(A) requires a statement that the consumer should see the details disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B), and, as shown on forms H-25(E) and H-25(G) of appendix H to this part, the statement, “See Payoffs and Payments,” in which the words “Payoffs and Payments” are in boldface, complies with this provision.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-e-Interp-5" id="38-e-Interp-5">5. <strong>Statement of increase or decrease.</strong> Section 1026.38(e)(1)(iii)(A) requires a statement of whether the loan amount increased or decreased. A creditor complies with this requirement by disclosing, “This amount increased” or “This amount decreased” with the words “increase” and “decrease” in boldface font.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-e-Interp-6" id="38-e-Interp-6">6. <strong>Estimated amounts.</strong> The amounts disclosed on the alternative calculating cash to close table under the subheading “Loan Estimate” under §&#160;1026.38(e)(1)(i), (2)(i), (4)(i), and (5)(i) are the amounts disclosed on the most recent Loan Estimate provided to the consumer under §&#160;1026.19(e).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-e-2-iii-A-Interp-1" id="38-e-2-iii-A-Interp-1">1. <strong>Statements and references regarding the total loan costs and total other costs.</strong> Under §&#160;1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A), the statements under the subheading “Did this change?” that the consumer should see the total loan costs and total other costs subtotals disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under §&#160;1026.38(f)(4) and (g)(5) are made only if and to the extent the difference in the “Total Closing Costs” is attributable to differences in itemized charges that are included in either or both of such subtotals.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-e-2-iii-A-Interp-1-i" id="38-e-2-iii-A-Interp-1-i">i. For example, if an increase in the “Total Closing Costs” is attributable only to an increase in the appraisal fee (which is an itemized charge on the Closing Disclosure under the subheading “Services Borrower Did Not Shop For,” itself under the heading “Loan Costs”), then a statement is given under the subheading “Did this change?” that the consumer should see the total loan costs subtotal disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under §&#160;1026.38(f)(4). If the increase in “Total Closing Costs” is attributable only to an increase in recording fees (which is an itemized charge on the Closing Disclosure under the subheading “Taxes and Other Government Fees,” itself under the heading “Other Costs”), then a statement is given under the subheading “Did this change?” that the consumer should see the total other costs subtotal disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under §&#160;1026.38(g)(5). If, however, the increase is attributable in part to an increase in the appraisal fee and in part to an increase in the recording fee, then a statement is given under the subheading “Did this change?” that the consumer should see the total loan costs and total other costs subtotals disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under §&#160;1026.38(f)(4) and (g)(5).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-e-2-iii-A-Interp-2" id="38-e-2-iii-A-Interp-2">2. <strong>Disclosure of excess amounts above limitations on increases in closing costs.</strong></p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-e-2-iii-A-Interp-2-i" id="38-e-2-iii-A-Interp-2-i">i. Because certain closing costs, individually, are generally subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) (<strong>e.g.,</strong> fees paid to the creditor, transfer taxes, fees paid to an affiliate of the creditor), while other closing costs are collectively subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) (<em>e.g.,</em> recording fees, fees paid to an unaffiliated third party identified by the creditor if the creditor permitted the consumer to shop for the service provider), §&#160;1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A) requires the creditor or closing agent to calculate subtotals for each type of excess amount, and then add such subtotals together to yield the dollar amount to be disclosed in the table. See commentary to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3) for additional guidance on calculating excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-e-2-iii-A-Interp-2-ii" id="38-e-2-iii-A-Interp-2-ii">ii. Under §&#160;1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A), calculation of the excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into account that the itemized, estimated closing costs disclosed on the Loan Estimate will not result in charges to the consumer if the service is not actually provided at or before consummation. For example, if the Loan Estimate included under “Services You Cannot Shop For” a $30 charge for a “title courier fee,” but the title company elects to hand-deliver the title documents package to the creditor at no charge, the $30 fee is not factored into the calculation of the “Total Closing Costs” that are subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs. However, if the title courier fee was assessed, but at only $15, the charge is factored into the calculation because the third party service was actually provided, albeit at a lower amount than estimated. For an example, see form H-25 of appendix H to this part.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-e-2-iii-A-Interp-2-iii" id="38-e-2-iii-A-Interp-2-iii">iii. Under §&#160;1026.38(e)(2)(iii)(A), calculation of the excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into account that certain itemized charges listed on the Loan Estimate under the subheading “Services You Can Shop For” may be subject to different limitations depending on the circumstances. Although §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii) provides exceptions to the general rule, such a charge would generally be subject to the limitations under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) if the consumer decided to use a provider affiliated with the creditor. However, the same charge would instead be subject to the limitations under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) if the consumer selected a third party service provider unaffiliated with but identified by the creditor, and the creditor permitted the consumer to shop for the service provider. See commentary to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3) for additional guidance on calculating excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-g-3-Interp-1" id="38-g-3-Interp-1">1. <strong>Initial escrow account itemization.</strong> The creditor must state the amount that it will require the consumer to place into a reserve or escrow account at consummation to be applied to recurring charges for property taxes, homeowner's and similar insurance, mortgage insurance, homeowner's association dues, condominium dues, and other periodic charges. Each periodic charge to be included in the escrow or reserve account must be itemized under the “Initial Escrow Payment at Closing” subheading, with a relevant label, monthly payment amount, and number of months collected at closing.</p>

However, if such credit is attributable to a specific loan cost or other cost listed in the Closing Cost Details tables, pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(f) or (g), that amount should be reflected in the Paid by Others column in the Closing Cost Details tables under §&#160;1026.38(f) or (g). For a description of lender credits from the creditor, see comment 17(c)(1)-19. For a discussion of general lender credits and lender credits for specific charges, see comment 19(e)(3)(i)-5.</p>

If an excess charge to the consumer is discovered after consummation and a refund provided, the corrected disclosure must be provided to the consumer under §&#160;1026.19(f)(2)(v).

In addition, §&#160;1026.38(h)(4) requires the creditor to list the items disclosed under each subcategory of charges in a consistent order. If costs move between subheadings under §&#160;1026.38(f)(2) and (f)(3), listing the costs in alphabetical order in each subheading category is considered to be in compliance with §&#160;1026.38(h)(4).

<h3>38(i) Calculating cash to close.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-i-Interp-1" id="38-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>More prominent disclosures.</strong> Section 1026.38(i)(1)(iii), (2)(iii), (3)(iii), (4)(iii), (5)(iii), (6)(iii), (7)(iii), and (8)(iii) requires that statements are given as to whether the “Final” amount disclosed under each subparagraph (ii) of §&#160;1026.38(i)(1) through (i)(8) is different or equal to, and in some cases whether the amount is greater than or less than, the corresponding “Loan Estimate” amount disclosed under each subparagraph (i) of §&#160;1026.38(i)(1) through (i)(8). These statements are more prominent than the other disclosures under §&#160;1026.38(i). The statement of whether the estimated and final amounts are different, stated as a “Yes” or “No” in capital letters and in boldface font, under the subheading “Did this change?,” as shown on form H-25 of appendix H to this part, complies with the requirement to state whether the amounts are different more prominently. Such statement of “No” satisfies the requirement to state that the estimated and final amounts are equal, and these sections do not provide for any narrative text to be included with such statement. The prominence requirement also requires that, in the event an increase or decrease in costs has occurred, certain words within the narrative text to be included under the subheading “Did this change?” for a “Yes” answer are displayed more prominently than other disclosures. For example, under §&#160;1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A), this more prominent statement could take the form of the phrases “Total Loan Costs” and “Total Other Costs” being shown in boldface, as shown on form H-25 of appendix H to this part. See comments 38(i)-3 and -4 for further guidance regarding the prominence of such statements.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-i-Interp-2" id="38-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>Statements of differences.</strong> The dollar amounts disclosed under §&#160;1026.38 generally are shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. <em>See</em> comment 38(t)(4)-1. Any amount in the “Final” column of the calculating cash to close table under §&#160;1026.38(i) is shown to two decimal places unless otherwise required. Under §&#160;1026.38(t)(4)(i)(C), however, any amount in the “Loan Estimate” column of the calculating cash to close table under §&#160;1026.38(i) is rounded to the nearest dollar amount to match the corresponding estimated amount disclosed on the Loan Estimate's calculating cash to close table under §&#160;1026.37(h). For purposes of §&#160;1026.38(i)(1)(iii), (3)(iii), (4)(iii), (5)(iii), (6)(iii), (7)(iii), and (8)(iii), each statement of a change between the amounts disclosed on the Loan Estimate and the Closing Disclosure is based on the actual, non-rounded estimate that would have been disclosed on the Loan Estimate under §&#160;1026.37(h) if it had been shown to two decimal places rather than a whole dollar amount. For example, if the amount in the “Loan Estimate” column of the total closing costs row disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(i)(1)(i) is $12,500, but the non-rounded estimate of total closing costs is $12,500.35, and the amount in the “Final” column of the total closing costs row disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(i)(1)(ii) is $12,500.35, then, even though the table would appear to show a $0.35 increase in total closing costs, no statement of such increase is given under §&#160;1026.38(i)(1)(iii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-i-Interp-3" id="38-i-Interp-3">3. <strong>Statements that the consumer should see details.</strong> The provisions of §&#160;1026.38(i)(4)(iii)(A), (5)(iii)(A), (7)(iii)(A), and (8)(iii)(A) each require a statement that the consumer should see certain details of the closing costs disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(j). Form H-25 of appendix H to this part contains some examples of these statements. For example, §&#160;1026.38(i)(5)(iii)(A) requires a statement that the consumer should see the details disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(j)(2)(ii). The following statement, which is similar to that shown on form H-25(B) of appendix H to this part for §&#160;1026.38(i)(7)(iii)(A), “See Deposit in Section L,” in which the words “Section L” are in boldface font, complies with this provision. In addition, for example, the statement “See details in Sections K and L,” in which the words “Sections K and L” are in boldface font, complies with the requirement under §&#160;1026.38(i)(8)(iii)(A). See form H-25(B) of appendix H to this part for an example of the statement required by §&#160;1026.38(i)(8)(iii)(A). See also comment 38(i)(7)(iii)(A)-1 for additional examples that comply with the requirements under §&#160;1026.38(i)(7)(iii)(A).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-i-Interp-4" id="38-i-Interp-4">4. <strong>Statements of increases or decreases.</strong> The provisions of §&#160;1026.38(i)(4)(iii)(A), (i)(5)(iii)(A), and (i)(6)(iii)(A) each require a statement of whether the amount increased or decreased from the estimated amount. For the statement required by §&#160;1026.38(i)(6)(iii)(A), the statement “This amount increased,” in which the word “increased” is in boldface and is replaced with the word “decreased” as applicable, complies with this requirement. For the statements required by §&#160;1026.38(i)(4)(iii)(A) and (i)(5)(iii)(A), the statement, “You increased this payment,” in which the word “increased” is in boldface and is replaced with the word “decreased” as applicable, complies with these requirements.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-i-1-iii-A-Interp-1-i" id="38-i-1-iii-A-Interp-1-i">i. For example, if an increase in the “Total Closing Costs” is attributable only to an increase in the appraisal fee (which is an itemized charge on the Closing Disclosure under the subheading “Services Borrower Did Not Shop For,” itself under the heading “Loan Costs”), then a statement is given under the subheading “Did this change?” that the consumer should see the total loan costs subtotal disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under §&#160;1026.38(f)(4). If the increase in “Total Closing Costs” is attributable only to an increase in recording fees (which is an itemized charge on the Closing Disclosure under the subheading “Taxes and Other Government Fees,” itself under the heading “Other Costs”), then a statement is given under the subheading “Did this change?” that the consumer should see the total other costs subtotal disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under §&#160;1026.38(g)(5). If, however, the increase is attributable in part to an increase in the appraisal fee and in part to an increase in the recording fee, then a statement is given under the subheading “Did this change?” that the consumer should see the total loan costs and total other costs subtotals disclosed on the Closing Disclosure under §&#160;1026.38(f)(4) and (g)(5).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-i-1-iii-A-Interp-2" id="38-i-1-iii-A-Interp-2">2. <strong>Disclosure of excess amounts above limitations on increases in closing costs.</strong></p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-i-1-iii-A-Interp-2-i" id="38-i-1-iii-A-Interp-2-i">i. Because certain closing costs, individually, are generally subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) (<strong>e.g.,</strong> fees paid to the creditor, transfer taxes, fees paid to an affiliate of the creditor), while other closing costs are collectively subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) (<em>e.g.,</em> recording fees, fees paid to an unaffiliated third party identified by the creditor if the creditor permitted the consumer to shop for the service provider), §&#160;1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A) requires the creditor or closing agent to calculate subtotals for each type of excess amount, and then add such subtotals together to yield the dollar amount to be disclosed in the table. See commentary to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3) for additional guidance on calculating excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-i-1-iii-A-Interp-2-ii" id="38-i-1-iii-A-Interp-2-ii">ii. Under §&#160;1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A), calculation of the excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into account that the itemized, estimated closing costs disclosed on the Loan Estimate will not result in charges to the consumer if the service is not actually provided at or before consummation. For example, if the Loan Estimate included under “Services You Cannot Shop For” a $30 charge for a “title courier fee,” but the title company elects to hand-deliver the title documents package to the creditor at no charge, the $30 fee is not factored into the calculation of the “Total Closing Costs” that are subject to the limitations on increases in closing costs. However, if the title courier fee was assessed, but at only $15, the charge is factored into the calculation because the third-party service was actually provided, albeit at a lower amount than estimated.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-i-1-iii-A-Interp-2-iii" id="38-i-1-iii-A-Interp-2-iii">iii. Under §&#160;1026.38(i)(1)(iii)(A), calculation of the excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs takes into account that certain itemized charges listed on the Loan Estimate under the subheading “Services You Can Shop For” may be subject to different limitations depending on the circumstances. Although §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iii) provides exceptions to the general rule, such a charge would generally be subject to the limitations under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) if the consumer decided to use a provider affiliated with the creditor. However, the same charge would instead be subject to the limitations under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(ii) if the consumer selected a third-party service provider unaffiliated with but identified by the creditor, and the creditor permitted the consumer to shop for the service provider. See commentary to §&#160;1026.19(e)(3) for additional guidance on calculating excess amounts above the limitations on increases in closing costs under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-i-3-Interp-1-i" id="38-i-3-Interp-1-i">i. <em>Generally.</em> The amount of closing costs financed disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(i)(3) is determined by subtracting the total amount of payments to third parties not otherwise disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(f) and (g) from the loan amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(b). The total amount of payments to third parties includes the sale price of the property disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(ii). Other examples of payments to third parties not otherwise disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(f) and (g) include the amount of construction costs for transactions that involve improvements to be made on the property, and payoffs of secured or unsecured debt. If the result of the calculation is zero or negative, the amount of $0 is disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(i)(3). If the result of the calculation is positive, that amount is disclosed as a negative number under §&#160;1026.38(i)(3), but only to the extent that the absolute value of the amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(i)(3) does not exceed the total amount of closing costs disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(h)(1).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-i-3-Interp-1-ii" id="38-i-3-Interp-1-ii">ii. <strong>Simultaneous subordinate financing.</strong> For simultaneous subordinate financing transactions, no sale price will be disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(ii), and therefore no sale price will be included in the closing costs financed calculation as a payment to third parties. The total amount of payments to third parties only includes payments occurring in the simultaneous subordinate financing transaction other than payments toward the sale price.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-i-4-ii-A-Interp-1" id="38-i-4-ii-A-Interp-1">1. <strong>Down payment and funds from borrower calculation.</strong> Under §&#160;1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(<em>1</em>), the down payment and funds from borrower amount is calculated as the difference between the sale price of the property disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(A) and the sum of the loan amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(b) and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that is disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(j)(2)(iv), except as required by §&#160;1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(<em>2</em>). The calculation is independent of any loan program or investor requirements. The “Final” amount disclosed for “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” reflects any change, following delivery of the Loan Estimate, in the amount of down payment and other funds required of the consumer. This change might result, for example, from an increase in the purchase price of the property.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-i-4-ii-A-Interp-2" id="38-i-4-ii-A-Interp-2">2. <strong>Funds for borrower.</strong> Section 1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(<em>2</em>) requires that, in a purchase transaction as defined in §&#160;1026.37(a)(9)(i) that is a simultaneous subordinate financing transaction or that involves improvements to be made on the property, or when the sum of the loan amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(b) and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that is disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(j)(2)(iv) exceeds the sale price disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(A), the amount of funds from the consumer is determined in accordance with §&#160;1026.38(i)(6)(iv). Pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(i)(6)(iv), the “Final” amount of “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” to be disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(<em>2</em>) is determined by subtracting the sum of the loan amount and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that is disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(j)(2)(iv) (excluding any closing costs financed disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(i)(3)(ii)) from the total amount of all existing debt being satisfied in the transaction disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(ii), (iii), and (v). The amount of “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” under the subheading “Final” is disclosed either as a positive number or $0, depending on the result of the calculation. When the result of the calculation is positive, that amount is disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(<em>2</em>) as “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower,” and $0 is disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(i)(6)(ii) as “Funds for Borrower.” When the result of the calculation is negative, that amount is disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(i)(6)(ii) as “Funds for Borrower,” and $0 is disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(<em>2</em>) as “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower.” When the result is $0, $0 is disclosed as “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” and “Funds for Borrower” under §&#160;1026.38(i)(4)(ii)(A)(<em>2</em>) and (6)(ii), respectively. An increase in the amount of “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” under the subheading “Final” relative to the corresponding amount under the subheading “Loan Estimate” might result, for example, from a decrease in the loan amount or an increase in the amount of existing debt being satisfied in the transaction.

The applicable disclosure to be referenced corresponds to the label on the Closing Disclosure under which the information accounting for the increase in the “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” amount is disclosed. For example, in a transaction that is a purchase as defined in §&#160;1026.37(a)(9)(i), if the purchase price of the property has increased and therefore caused the “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” amount to increase, the statement, “You increased this payment. See details in Section K,” with the words “increased” and “Section K” in boldface, complies with this requirement. In a purchase or refinancing transaction, in the event the amount of the credit extended by the creditor has decreased and therefore caused the “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” amount to increase, the statement can read, for example, “You increased this payment.

For example, credits a consumer receives from a real estate agent or other third party, other than a seller or creditor, are disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(j)(2)(vi). However, if the credit is attributable to a specific closing cost listed in the Closing Cost Details tables under §&#160;1026.38(f) or (g), that amount should be reflected in the paid by others column on the Closing Cost Details tables and not in the disclosure required under §&#160;1026.38(j)(2)(vi). Similarly, if a real estate agent rebates a portion of the agent's commission to the consumer, the rebate should be listed as a credit along with a description of the rebate, which must include the name of the party giving the credit.</p>

For example, if the consumer is using a second mortgage loan to finance part of the purchase price, whether from the same creditor, another creditor, or the seller, the principal amount of the second loan must be disclosed with a brief explanation on the first-lien Closing Disclosure. In this example, the principal amount of the subordinate financing is disclosed on the summaries of transactions table for the borrower's transaction either on line 04 under the subheading “L. Paid Already by or on Behalf of Borrower at Closing,” or under the subheading “Other Credits.” If the net proceeds of the subordinate financing are less than the principal amount of the subordinate financing, the net proceeds must also be listed, and may be listed on the same line as the principal amount of the subordinate financing on the first-lien Closing Disclosure. For an example, see form H-25(C) of appendix H to this part.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-j-2-vi-Interp-3" id="38-j-2-vi-Interp-3">3. <strong>Satisfaction of existing subordinate liens by consumer.</strong> For payments to subordinate lien holders by or on behalf of the consumer, disclosure of any amounts paid with funds other than closing funds, as defined under §&#160;1026.38(j)(4)(ii), in connection with the second mortgage payoff are required to be disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(j)(2)(vi), with a statement that such amounts were paid outside of closing funds. For an example, see form H-25(D) of appendix H to this part.</p>

Amounts provided in advance of the real estate closing to consumers by third parties, including family members, not otherwise associated with the transaction, are not required to be disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(j)(2)(vi).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-j-2-vi-Interp-6" id="38-j-2-vi-Interp-6">6. <strong>Adjustments.</strong> Section 1026.38(j)(2)(vi) requires the disclosure of any additional amounts not already disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(f), (g), (h), and (j)(2), that are owed to the consumer but payable to the seller before the real estate closing. The disclosures made under §&#160;1026.38(j)(2)(vi) must also include a description for each disclosed amount. For example, rent paid to the seller from a tenant before the real estate closing for a period extending beyond the real estate closing is disclosed by identifying the amount as rent from a tenant under the heading “Adjustments.” See also §&#160;1026.38(k)(2)(viii), which requires disclosure of a description and amount of any and all other obligations required to be paid by the seller at the real estate closing.</p>

Section 1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)(<em>1</em>) requires a disclosure, labeled “Escrowed Property Costs over Year 1,” calculated as the amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)(<em>4</em>) multiplied by the number of periodic payments scheduled to be made to the escrow account during the first year after consummation. For example, creditors may base such disclosures on less than 12 payments if, based on the payment schedule dictated by the legal obligation, fewer than 12 periodic payments will be made to the escrow account during the first year after consummation. Alternatively, §&#160;1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)(<em>5</em>) permits the creditor to base the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)(<em>1</em>) and (<em>4</em>) on amounts derived from the escrow account analysis required under Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.17, even if those disclosures differ from what would otherwise be disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(l)(7)(i)(A)(<em>1</em>) and (<em>4</em>) - as, for example, when there are fewer than 12 periodic payments scheduled to be made to the escrow account during the first year after consummation.</p>

<h3>38(o) Loan calculations.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-o-Interp-1" id="38-o-Interp-1">1. <strong>Examples.</strong> Section 1026.38(o)(1) and (2) sets forth the accuracy requirements for the total of payments and the finance charge, respectively. The following examples illustrate the interaction of these provisions:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-o-Interp-1-i" id="38-o-Interp-1-i">i. Assume that loan costs that are designated borrower-paid at or before closing and that are part of the finance charge (see §&#160;1026.4 for calculation of the finance charge) are understated by more than $100. For example, assume that borrower-paid loan origination fees (see §&#160;1026.4(a)) are cumulatively understated by $150, resulting in the amounts disclosed as the total of payments and the finance charge both being understated by more than $100. Both the disclosed total of payments and the disclosed finance charge would not be accurate for purposes of §&#160;1026.38(o)(1) and (2), respectively.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-o-Interp-1-ii" id="38-o-Interp-1-ii">ii. Assume that loan costs that are designated borrower-paid at or before closing and that are not part of the finance charge are understated by more than $100. For example, assume that borrower-paid property appraisal and inspection fees that are excluded from the finance charge under §&#160;1026.4(c)(7)(iv) are cumulatively understated by $150, resulting in the amount disclosed as the total of payments being understated by more than $100. The disclosed total of payments would not be accurate for purposes of §&#160;1026.38(o)(1), but the disclosed finance charge would be accurate for purposes of §&#160;1026.38(o)(2).</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="38-o-1-Interp" id="38-o-1-Interp"></div>
<h3>38(o)(1) Total of payments.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-o-1-Interp-1" id="38-o-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Calculation of total of payments.</strong> The total of payments is the total, expressed as a dollar amount, the consumer will have paid after making all payments of principal, interest, mortgage insurance, and loan costs, as scheduled, through the end of the loan term. The total of payments excludes charges that would otherwise be included as components of the total of payments if such charges are designated on the Closing Disclosure as paid by seller or paid by others. A seller or other party, such as the creditor, may agree to offset payments of principal, interest, mortgage insurance, or loan costs, whether in whole or in part, through a specific credit, for example through a specific seller or lender credit. Because these amounts are not paid by the consumer, they are excluded from the total of payments calculation. Non-specific credits, however, are generalized payments to the consumer that do not pay for a particular fee and therefore do not offset amounts for purposes of the total of payments calculation. For guidance on the amounts included in the total of payments calculation, see the “In 5 Years” disclosure under §&#160;1026.37(l)(1)(i) and comment 37(l)(1)(i)-1. For a discussion of lender credits, see comment 19(e)(3)(i)-5. For a discussion of seller credits, see comment 38(j)(2)(v)-1.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-p-1-Interp-1" id="38-p-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Applicability.</strong> The disclosure required by §&#160;1026.38(p)(1) is only applicable to closed-end transactions subject to §&#160;1026.19(f) that are also subject either to 15 U.S.C. 1639h or 1691(e), as implemented by this part or Regulation B, 12 CFR part 1002, respectively. Accordingly, if a transaction is not subject to either of those provisions, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.38(p)(1) may be left blank on form H-25 of appendix H to this part.</p>

<h3>38(p)(3) Liability after foreclosure.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-p-3-Interp-1" id="38-p-3-Interp-1">1. <strong>State law requirements.</strong> If the creditor forecloses on the property and the proceeds of the foreclosure sale are less than the unpaid balance on the loan, whether the consumer has continued or additional responsibility for the loan balance after foreclosure, and the conditions under which liability occurs, will vary by State. If the applicable State law affords any type of protection, other than a statute of limitations that only limits the timeframe in which a creditor may seek redress, §&#160;1026.38(p)(3) requires a statement that State law may protect the consumer from liability for the unpaid balance.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 38(q)(3).</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-q-3-Interp-1" id="38-q-3-Interp-1">1. <strong>Prominent question mark.</strong> The notice required under §&#160;1026.38(q) includes a prominent question mark. This prominent question mark is an aspect of form H-25 of appendix H to this part, the standard form or model form, as applicable, pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(t). If the creditor deviates from the depiction of the question mark as shown on form H-25, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.38(q) if (1) the size and location of the question mark on the Closing Disclosure are substantially similar in size and location to the question mark shown on form H-25, and (2) the creditor otherwise complies with §&#160;1026.38(t)(5) regarding permissible changes to the form of the Closing Disclosure.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="38-r-Interp" id="38-r-Interp"></div>
<h3>38(r) Contact information.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-r-Interp-1" id="38-r-Interp-1">1. <strong>Each person to be identified.</strong> Form H-25 of appendix H to this part includes the contact information required to be disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r) generally in a five-column tabular format (<em>i.e.,</em> there are columns from left to right that disclose the contact information for the creditor, mortgage broker, consumer's real estate broker, seller's real estate broker, and settlement agent). Columns are left blank where no such person is participating in the transaction. For example, if there is no mortgage broker involved in the transaction, the column for the mortgage broker is left blank. Conversely, in the event the transaction involves more than one of each such person (<em>e.g.,</em> two sellers' real estate brokers splitting a commission), the space in the contact information table provided on form H-25 of appendix H to this part may be altered to accommodate the information for such persons, provided that the information required by §&#160;1026.38(o),(p),(q),(r) and (s) is disclosed on the same page as illustrated by form H-25. If the space provided on form H-25 does not accommodate the addition of such information, an additional table to accommodate the information may be provided on a separate page, with an appropriate reference to the additional table. A creditor or settlement agent may also omit a column on the table that is inapplicable or, if necessary, replace an inapplicable column with the contact information for the additional person.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-r-Interp-2" id="38-r-Interp-2">2. <strong>Name of person.</strong> Where §&#160;1026.38(r)(1) calls for disclosure of the name of the person participating in the transaction, the person's legal name (<em>e.g.,</em> the name used for registration, incorporation, or chartering purposes), the person's trade name, if any, or an abbreviation of the person's legal name or the trade name is disclosed, so long as the disclosure is clear and conspicuous as required by §&#160;1026.38(t)(1)(i). For example, if the creditor's legal name is “Alpha Beta Chi Bank and Trust Company, N.A.” and its trade name is “ABC Bank,” then under §&#160;1026.38(r)(1) the full legal name, the trade name, or an abbreviation such as “ABC Bank &amp; Trust Co.” may be disclosed. However, the abbreviation “Bank &amp; Trust Co.” is not sufficiently distinct to enable a consumer to identify the person, and therefore would not be clear and conspicuous. If the creditor, mortgage broker, seller's real estate broker, consumer's real estate broker, or settlement agent participating in the transaction is a natural person, the natural person's name is listed in the §&#160;1026.38(r)(1) and (r)(4) disclosures (assuming that such natural person is the primary contact for the consumer or seller, as applicable).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-r-Interp-3" id="38-r-Interp-3">3. <strong>Address.</strong> The address disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(2) is the identified person's place of business where the primary contact for the transaction is located (usually the local office), rather than a general corporate headquarters address. If a natural person's name is to be disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(1), <em>see</em> comment 38(r)-2, the business address of such natural person is listed (assuming that such natural person is the primary contact for the consumer or seller, as applicable).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-r-Interp-4" id="38-r-Interp-4">4. <strong>NMLSR ID.</strong> Section 1026.38(r)(3) and (5) requires the disclosure of an NMLSR identification (ID) number for each person identified in the table. The NMLSR ID is a unique number or other identifier that is generally assigned by the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System &amp; Registry (NMLSR) to individuals registered or licensed through NMLSR to provide loan originating services (for more information, see the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act) sections 1503(3) and (12) and 1504, 12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12) and 5103, and its implementing regulations (<em>i.e.,</em> 12 CFR 1007.103(a) and 1008.103(a)(2)). An entity may also have an NMLSR ID. Thus, any NMLSR ID that is obtained by a creditor or mortgage broker entity disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(1), as applicable, or a natural person disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(4), either as required under the SAFE Act or otherwise, is disclosed. If the creditor, mortgage broker, or natural person has an NMLSR ID and a separate license number or unique identifier issued by the applicable State, locality, or other regulatory body with responsibility for licensing and/or registering such entity or person's business activities, both the NMLSR ID and the separate license number or unique identifier may be disclosed. The space in the table is left blank for the disclosures in the columns corresponding to persons that have no NMLSR ID to be disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(3) and (5); provided that, the creditor may omit the column from the table or, if necessary, replace the column with the contact information for an additional person. <em>See</em> comment 38(r)-1.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-r-Interp-5" id="38-r-Interp-5">5. <strong>License number or unique identifier.</strong> Section 1026.38(r)(3) and (5) requires the disclosure of a license number or unique identifier for each person (including natural persons) identified in the table who does not have a NMLSR ID if the applicable State, locality, or other regulatory body with responsibility for licensing and/or registering such person's business activities has issued a license number or other unique identifier to such person under §&#160;1026.38(r)(3) and (5). The space in the table is left blank for the disclosures in the columns corresponding to persons who are not subject to the issuance of such a license number or unique identifier to be disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(3) and (5); provided that, the creditor or settlement agent may omit the column from the table or, if necessary, replace the column with the contact information for an additional person. <em>See</em> comment 38(r)-1. In addition, under §&#160;1026.38(r)(3) and (5), the abbreviation of the State or the jurisdiction or regulatory body that issued such license or registration is required to be included before the word “License” in the label required by §&#160;1026.37(r)(3) and (5). If no such license or registration is required to be disclosed, such as if an NMLSR number is disclosed, the space provided for such an abbreviation in form H-25 of appendix H to this part may be left blank. A creditor complies with the requirements of §&#160;1026.38(r)(3) and (5) to disclose the abbreviation of the State by disclosing a U.S. Postal Service State abbreviation, if applicable.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-r-Interp-6" id="38-r-Interp-6">6. <strong>Contact.</strong> Section 1026.38(r)(4) requires the disclosure of the primary contact for the consumer. The primary contact is the natural person employed by the person disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(1) who interacts most frequently with the consumer and who has an NMLSR ID or, if none, a license number or other unique identifier to be disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(5), as applicable. For example, if the senior loan officer employed by the creditor or mortgage broker disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(1) has an NMLSR ID, but the consumer meets with a different loan officer to complete the application and answer questions, the senior loan officer's name is disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(4) unless the other loan officer also has an NMLSR ID, in which case the other loan officer's name is disclosed. Further, if the sales agent employed by the consumer's real estate broker disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(1) has a State-issued brokers' license number, but the consumer meets with an associate sales agent to tour the property being purchased and complete the sales contract, the sales agent's name is disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(4) unless the associate sales agent also has a State-issued license number, in which case the associate sales agent's name is disclosed. Moreover, if the closing attorney employed by the settlement agent disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(1) has a State-issued settlement agent license number, but the consumer meets with the attorney's assistant to fill out any necessary documentation prior to the closing and to answer questions, the closing attorney's name is disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(r)(4) because the assistant is only performing clerical functions.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-r-Interp-7" id="38-r-Interp-7">7. <strong>Email address and phone number.</strong> Section 1026.38(r)(6) and (7) requires disclosure of the email address and phone number, respectively, for the persons listed in §&#160;1026.37(r)(4). Disclosure of a general number or email address for the lender, mortgage broker, real estate broker, or settlement agent, as applicable, satisfies this requirement if no such information is generally available for such person.</p>

<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="38-t-1-Interp" id="38-t-1-Interp"></div>
<h3>38(t)(1) General requirements.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-1-Interp-1" id="38-t-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Clear and conspicuous; segregation.</strong> The clear and conspicuous standard requires that the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.38 be legible and in a readily understandable form. The disclosures also must be grouped together and segregated from everything else. As required by §&#160;1026.38(t)(3), the disclosures for any transaction that is a federally related mortgage loan under Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.2, must be made using the standard form H-25 of appendix H to this part. Accordingly, use of that form constitutes compliance with the clear and conspicuous and segregation requirements of §&#160;1026.38(t)(1).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-1-Interp-2" id="38-t-1-Interp-2">2. <strong>Balloon payment financing with leasing characteristics.</strong> In certain credit sale or loan transactions, a consumer may reduce the dollar amount of the payments to be made during the course of the transaction by agreeing to make, at the end of the loan term, a large final payment based on the expected residual value of the property. The consumer may have a number of options with respect to the final payment, including, among other things, retaining the property and making the final payment, refinancing the final payment, or transferring the property to the creditor in lieu of the final payment. Such transactions may have some of the characteristics of lease transactions subject to Regulation M (12 CFR part 1013), but are considered credit transactions where the consumer assumes the indicia of ownership, including the risks, burdens and benefits of ownership, upon consummation. These transactions are governed by the disclosure requirements of this part instead of Regulation M. Under §&#160;1026.38(t)(1)(ii), creditors may not include any additional information in the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.38. Thus, the disclosures must show the large final payment as a balloon payment in the projected payments table required by §&#160;1026.38(c) and should not, for example, reflect the other options available to the consumer at maturity.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="38-t-2-Interp" id="38-t-2-Interp"></div>
<h3>38(t)(2) Headings and labels.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-2-Interp-1" id="38-t-2-Interp-1">1. <strong>Estimated amounts.</strong> Certain amounts are estimated when provided on the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37. When disclosed as required by §&#160;1026.38, however, many of the corresponding disclosures must be actual amounts rather than estimates in accordance with the requirements of §&#160;1026.19(f), even though the provision of §&#160;1026.38 cross-references a counterpart in §&#160;1026.37. Section 1026.38(t)(2) provides that, if a master heading, heading, subheading, label, or similar designation contains the word “estimated” in form H-25 of appendix H to this part, that heading, label, or similar designation shall contain the word “estimated.” Thus, §&#160;1026.38(t)(2) incorporates the “estimated” designations reflected on form H-25 into the requirements of §&#160;1026.38. <em>See</em> comment 37(o)(2)-1.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="38-t-3-Interp" id="38-t-3-Interp"></div>
<h3>38(t)(3) Form.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-3-Interp-1" id="38-t-3-Interp-1">1. <strong>Non-federally related mortgage loans.</strong> For a transaction that is not a federally related mortgage loan, the creditor is not required to use form H-25 of appendix H to this part, although its use as a model form for such transactions, if properly completed with accurate content, constitutes compliance with the clear and conspicuous and segregation requirements of §&#160;1026.38(t)(1)(i). Even when the creditor elects not to use the model form, §&#160;1026.38(t)(1)(ii) requires that the disclosures contain only the information required by §&#160;1026.38(a) through (s), and that the creditor make the disclosures in the same order as they occur in form H-25, use the same headings, labels, and similar designations as used in the form (many of which also are expressly required by §&#160;1026.38(a) through (s)), and position the disclosures relative to those designations in the same manner as shown in the form. In order to be in a format substantially similar to form H-25, the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.38 must be provided on letter size (8.5″ x 11″) paper.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="38-t-4-Interp" id="38-t-4-Interp"></div>
<h3>38(t)(4) Rounding.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-4-Interp-1" id="38-t-4-Interp-1">1. <strong>Generally.</strong> Consistent with §&#160;1026.2(b)(4), any amount required to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.38 and not required to be rounded by §&#160;1026.38(t)(4) must be disclosed as an exact numerical amount using decimal places where applicable, unless otherwise provided. For example, under §&#160;1026.38(t)(4), the principal and interest payment disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(b)(3) and §&#160;1026.38(b) must be disclosed using decimal places even if the amount of cents is zero, in contrast to the loan amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(b)(1) and §&#160;1026.38(b).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-4-Interp-2" id="38-t-4-Interp-2">2. <strong>Guidance.</strong> For guidance regarding the requirements of §&#160;1026.38(t)(4), see the commentary to §&#160;1026.37(o)(4).</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="38-t-5-Interp" id="38-t-5-Interp"></div>
<h3>38(t)(5) Exceptions.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-Interp-1" id="38-t-5-Interp-1">1. <strong>Permissible changes.</strong> The changes required and permitted by §&#160;1026.38(t)(5) are permitted for federally related mortgage loans for which the use of form H-25 is required under §&#160;1026.38(t)(3). For non-federally related mortgage loans, the changes required or permitted by §&#160;1026.38(t)(5), do not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure and therefore, are permissible. Any changes to the disclosure not specified in §&#160;1026.38(t)(5) or not permitted by other provisions of §&#160;1026.38 are not permissible for federally related mortgage loans. Creditors in non-federally related mortgage loans making any changes that affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure will lose their protection from civil liability under TILA section 130.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-Interp-2" id="38-t-5-Interp-2">2. <strong>Manual completion.</strong> The creditor, or settlement agent preparing the form, under §&#160;1026.19(f)(1)(v) is not required to use a computer, typewriter, or other word processor to complete the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.38. The creditor or settlement agent may fill in information and amounts required to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.38 on form H-25 of appendix H to this part by hand printing or using any other method, provided the person produces clear and legible text and uses the formatting required by §&#160;1026.38, including replicating bold font where required.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-Interp-3" id="38-t-5-Interp-3">3. <strong>Unit-period.</strong> Section 1026.38(t)(5)(i) provides that wherever form H-25 or §&#160;1026.38 uses “monthly” to describe the frequency of any payments or uses “month” to describe the applicable unit-period, the creditor is required to substitute the appropriate term to reflect the fact that the transaction's terms provide for other than monthly periodic payments, such as bi-weekly or quarterly payments. For purposes of §&#160;1026.38, the term “unit-period” has the same meaning as in appendix J to Regulation Z.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-Interp-4" id="38-t-5-Interp-4">4. <strong>Signature lines.</strong> Section 1026.38(t) does not restrict the addition of signature lines to the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.38, provided any signature lines for confirmations of receipt of the disclosure appear only under the “Confirm Receipt” heading required by §&#160;1026.38(s) as illustrated by form H-25 of appendix H to this part. If the number of signatures requested by the creditor for confirming receipt of the disclosure requires space for signature lines in excess of that provided on form H-25, an additional page may be added to accommodate the additional signature lines with an appropriate reference to the additional page. Such additional page should also contain the heading and statement required by §&#160;1026.38(s) in the format provided on form H-25. Signatures for a purpose other than confirming receipt of the form may be obtained on a separate page, and consistent with §&#160;1026.38(t)(1)(i), not on the same page as the information required by §&#160;1026.38.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-Interp-5" id="38-t-5-Interp-5">5. <strong>Additional page.</strong> Information required or permitted to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.38 on a separate page should be formatted similarly to form H-25 of appendix H to this part, so as not to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure. In addition, information provided on additional pages should be consolidated on as few pages as necessary so as not to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-Interp-6" id="38-t-5-Interp-6">6. <strong>Page numbers.</strong> References required by provisions of §&#160;1026.38 to information disclosed pursuant to other provisions of the section, as illustrated on form H-25 of appendix H, may be altered to refer to the appropriate page number of the form containing such information.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-Interp-7" id="38-t-5-Interp-7">7. <strong>Translation.</strong> Section 1026.38(t)(5)(viii) permits the translation of form H-25 into languages other than English, similar to §&#160;1026.37(o)(5)(ii). Pursuant §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(viii) creditors may modify form H-25 to the extent that translation prevents the headings, labels, designations, and required disclosure items under §&#160;1026.38 from fitting in the space provided on form H-25. For example, if the translation of a required label does not fit within the line provided for such label in form H-25, the label may be disclosed over two lines. See form H-28 of appendix H to this part for Spanish translations of form H-25.</p>

<h3>38(t)(5)(iv) Closing Cost Details.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-iv-Interp-1" id="38-t-5-iv-Interp-1">1. <strong>Line numbers; closing cost details.</strong> Section 1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(A) permits the deletion of unused lines from the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.38(f)(1) through (3) and (g)(1) through (4), if necessary to allow the addition of lines to other sections that require them for the required disclosures. This provision permits creditors and settlement agents to use the space gained from deleting unused lines for additional lines to accommodate all of the costs that are required to be itemized. For example, if the only origination charge required by §&#160;1026.38(f)(1) is points, the remaining seven lines illustrated on form H-25 of appendix H to this part may be deleted and added to the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.38(g)(4), if seven lines in addition to those provided on form H-25 are necessary to accommodate such disclosure.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-iv-Interp-2" id="38-t-5-iv-Interp-2">2. <strong>Two pages; closing cost details.</strong> Section 1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(B) permits the disclosure of the information required by §&#160;1026.38(f) through (h) over two pages, but only if form H-25 of appendix H to this part, as modified pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(A), does not accommodate all of the costs required to be disclosed on one page. If the deletion of unused lines and the addition of such lines to other sections permits the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.38(f) through (h) to fit on one page, modification pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(B) is not permissible.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-iv-Interp-3" id="38-t-5-iv-Interp-3">3. <strong>Separate pages for Loan Costs and Other Costs.</strong> The modification permitted by §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(B) allows the information required by §&#160;1026.38(f) through (h) to be disclosed over two pages, numbered as “2a” and “2b.” For an example of such a modification, see form H-25(H) of appendix H to this part. Under this modification, the information required by §&#160;1026.38(h) must remain on the same page as the information required by §&#160;1026.38(g). Accordingly, the Loan Costs section of form H-25 may appear on its own page “2a,” but the Other Costs section must appear on the same page as the Total Closing Costs section on page “2b.” The modifications permitted by §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(iv)(A) and (B) may be used in conjunction to ensure disclosure of §&#160;1026.38(f) on one page and §&#160;1026.38(g) and (h) on a separate page.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="38-t-5-v-Interp-1-iii" id="38-t-5-v-Interp-1-iii">iii. Provide to the seller, or assist the settlement agent in providing to the seller, a modified version of the form under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vi), as illustrated by form H-25(I) of appendix H to this part.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-v-Interp-2" id="38-t-5-v-Interp-2">2. <strong>Provision of separate disclosure to consumer.</strong> If applicable State law prohibits sharing with the consumer the information disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(k), a creditor may provide a separate form to the consumer. A creditor may also provide a separate form to the consumer in any other situation where the creditor in its discretion chooses to do so, such as based on the seller's request. For the permissible form modifications to separate consumer and seller information, see comment 38(t)(5)(v)-1.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-v-Interp-3" id="38-t-5-v-Interp-3">3. <strong>Provision of separate disclosure to seller.</strong> To separate the information of the consumer and seller under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(v), a creditor may assist the settlement agent in providing (or provide when acting as a settlement agent) a separate form to the seller where applicable State law prohibits sharing with the seller the information disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(a)(2), (a)(4)(iii), (a)(5), (b) through (d), (f), or (g), with respect to closing costs paid by the consumer, or §&#160;1026.38(i), (j), (l) through (p), or (r), with respect to closing costs paid by the creditor and mortgage broker. A creditor may also assist the settlement agent in providing (or provide when acting as a settlement agent) a separate form to the seller in any other situation where the creditor in its discretion chooses to do so, such as based on the consumer's request.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-vii-Interp-1" id="38-t-5-vii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Alternative tables.</strong> The alternative tables pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(d)(2) and (e) are required to be disclosed to use the modification permitted under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii).</p>

As required by §&#160;1026.38(a)(3)(vii)(B), a form used for a transaction that does not involve a seller and is modified under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii) must contain the label “Appraised Prop. Value” or “Estimated Prop. Value” where there is no appraisal.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 38(t)(5)(vii)(B).</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-vii-B-Interp-1" id="38-t-5-vii-B-Interp-1">1. <strong>Amounts paid by third parties.</strong> Under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B), the payoffs and payments table itemizes the amounts of payments made at closing to other parties from the credit extended to the consumer or funds provided by the consumer, including designees of the consumer. Designees of the consumer for purposes of §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) include third parties who provide funds on behalf of the consumer. Such amounts may be disclosed as credits in the payoffs and payments table. Some examples of amounts paid by third parties that may be disclosed as credits on the payoffs and payments table under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) include gift funds, grants, proceeds from loans that satisfy the partial exemption criteria in §&#160;1026.3(h), and, on the Closing Disclosure for a simultaneous subordinate financing transaction, contributions from a seller for costs associated with the subordinate financing.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-vii-B-Interp-2" id="38-t-5-vii-B-Interp-2">2. <strong>Disclosure of subordinate financing.</strong> i. <em>First-lien Closing Disclosure.</em> On the Closing Disclosure for a first-lien transaction disclosed with the alternative tables pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(d)(2) and (e), such as a refinance transaction, that also has simultaneous subordinate financing, the proceeds of the subordinate financing are included in the payoffs and payments table under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B) by disclosing, as a credit, the principal amount of the subordinate financing, and, if the net proceeds of the subordinate financing are less than the principal amount of the subordinate financing, the net proceeds. The creditor may list the principal amount and net proceeds of the subordinate financing on the same line. For example, the creditor may disclose the principal amount of the subordinate financing under the subheading “To” with a description of the payment, and the net proceeds of the subordinate financing under the subheading “Amount.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-vii-B-Interp-ii" id="38-t-5-vii-B-Interp-ii">ii. <strong>Simultaneous subordinate financing Closing Disclosure.</strong> On the Closing Disclosure for a simultaneous subordinate financing transaction disclosed with the alternative tables pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(d)(2) and (e), the proceeds of the subordinate financing applied to the first-lien transaction may be included in the payoffs and payments table under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-vii-B-Interp-iii" id="38-t-5-vii-B-Interp-iii">iii. <strong>Simultaneous subordinate financing - seller contribution.</strong> If a creditor discloses the alternative tables pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(d)(2) and (e) on the simultaneous subordinate financing Closing Disclosure, the creditor must also disclose as a credit in the payoffs and payments table on the simultaneous subordinate financing Closing Disclosure, any contributions from the seller toward the simultaneous subordinate financing. For example, assume the subordinate-lien creditor provides the alternative tables pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(d)(2) and (e) on the simultaneous subordinate financing Closing Disclosure and the seller contributes $200.00 toward the closing costs of the simultaneous subordinate financing. The subordinate-lien creditor must disclose the $200.00 contribution as a credit on the simultaneous subordinate financing Closing Disclosure in the payoffs and payments table under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B). See also comments 38(j)-3 and 38(k)(2)(vii)-1 for disclosure requirements applicable to the first-lien transaction when the alternative disclosures are used for a simultaneous subordinate financing transaction and a seller contributes to the costs of the subordinate financing.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-vii-B-Interp-3" id="38-t-5-vii-B-Interp-3">3. <strong>Other examples.</strong> For additional examples of items disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B), see comment 37(h)(2)(iii)-1. See also comment 38-4 for an explanation of how to disclose a principal reduction under §&#160;1026.38(t)(5)(vii)(B).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="38-t-5-ix-Interp-1" id="38-t-5-ix-Interp-1">1. <strong>Customary recitals and information.</strong> Section 1026.38(t)(5)(ix) permits an additional page to be added to the disclosure for customary recitals and information used locally in real estate settlements. Examples of such information include a breakdown of payoff figures, a breakdown of the consumer's total monthly mortgage payments, check disbursements, a statement indicating receipt of funds, applicable special stipulations between buyer and seller, and the date funds are transferred.</p>

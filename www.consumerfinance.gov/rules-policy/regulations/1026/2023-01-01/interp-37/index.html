            <p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="1" id="1"><strong>1. Disclosures not applicable.</strong> The disclosures required by §&#160;1026.37 are required to reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the parties, and if any information necessary for an accurate disclosure is unknown to the creditor, the creditor shall make the disclosure in good faith, based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor pursuant to §§&#160;1026.17(c) and 1026.19(e). See comments 17(c)(1)-1, 17(c)(2)(i)-1 and -2, and 19(e)(1)(i)-1. Where a disclosure is not applicable to a particular transaction, unless otherwise provided by §&#160;1026.37, form H-24 of appendix H to this part may not be modified to delete the disclosure from form H-24, or to state “not applicable” or “N/A” in place of such disclosure. The portion of the form pertaining to the inapplicable disclosure may be left blank, unless otherwise provided by §&#160;1026.37. For example, in a transaction for which the consumer does not pay points to the creditor to reduce the interest rate, the amounts required to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.37(f)(1)(i) may be left blank on form H-24. As provided in §&#160;1026.37(i) and (j), however, the adjustable payment and adjustable interest rate tables required by those paragraphs may be included only if those disclosures are applicable to the transaction and otherwise must be excluded.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="2" id="2"><strong>2. Format.</strong> See §&#160;1026.37(o) and its commentary for guidance on the proper format to be used in making the disclosures, as well as permissible modifications.</p>

<h3>37(a) General information.</h3>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-a-3-Interp" id="37-a-3-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(a)(3) Creditor.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-3-Interp-1" id="37-a-3-Interp-1">1. <strong>Multiple creditors.</strong> For transactions with multiple creditors, see §&#160;1026.17(d) and comment 17(d)-1 for further guidance. The creditor making the disclosures, however, must be identified as the creditor for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(a)(3).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-3-Interp-2" id="37-a-3-Interp-2">2. <strong>Mortgage broker as loan originator.</strong> In transactions involving a mortgage broker, the name and address of the creditor must be disclosed, if known, even if the mortgage broker provides the disclosures to the consumer under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(ii). As required by §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), the mortgage broker must make a good faith effort to disclose the name and address of the creditor, but if the name of the creditor is not yet known, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(3) may be left blank. <em>See</em> comment 37-1.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-a-4-Interp" id="37-a-4-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(a)(4) Date issued.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-4-Interp-1" id="37-a-4-Interp-1">1. <strong>Applicable date.</strong> Section 1026.37(a)(4) requires disclosure of the date the creditor mails or delivers the Loan Estimate to the consumer. The creditor's method of delivery does not affect the date issued. For example, if the creditor hand delivers the Loan Estimate to the consumer on August 14, or if the creditor places the Loan Estimate in the mail on August 14, the date disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(a)(4) is August 14.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-4-Interp-2" id="37-a-4-Interp-2">2. <strong>Mortgage broker as loan originator.</strong> In transactions involving a mortgage broker, the date disclosed is the date the mortgage broker mails or delivers the Loan Estimate to the consumer, because pursuant to §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(ii), the mortgage broker is required to comply with all relevant requirements of §&#160;1026.19(e).</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-a-5-Interp" id="37-a-5-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(a)(5) Applicants.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-5-Interp-1" id="37-a-5-Interp-1">1. <strong>Multiple consumers.</strong> If there is more than one consumer applying for the credit, §&#160;1026.37(a)(5) requires disclosure of the name and the mailing address of each consumer to whom the Loan Estimate will be delivered. If the names and mailing addresses of all consumers applying for the credit do not fit in the space allocated on the Loan Estimate, an additional page with that information may be appended to the end of the form. For additional information on permissible changes, see §&#160;1026.37(o)(5) and its commentary.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-a-6-Interp" id="37-a-6-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(a)(6) Property.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-6-Interp-1" id="37-a-6-Interp-1">1. <strong>Alternate property address.</strong> Section 1026.37(a)(6) requires disclosure of the address including the zip code of the property that secures or will secure the transaction. A creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(a)(6) by disclosing a complete address for purposes of the U.S. Postal Service. If the address is unavailable, a creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(a)(6) by disclosing the location of such property including a zip code, which is required in all instances. Location of the property under §&#160;1026.37(a)(6) includes location information, such as a lot number. The disclosure of multiple zip codes is permitted if the consumer is investigating home purchase opportunities in multiple zip codes.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-6-Interp-2" id="37-a-6-Interp-2">2. <strong>Personal property.</strong> Where personal property also secures the credit transaction, a description of that property may be disclosed, at the creditor's option pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(a)(6), if a description fits in the space provided on form H-24 for the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(6). An additional page may not be appended to the form to disclose a description of personal property.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-6-Interp-3" id="37-a-6-Interp-3">3. <strong>Multiple properties.</strong> Where more than one property secures the credit transaction, §&#160;1026.37(a)(6) requires disclosure of all properties. If the addresses of all properties securing the transaction do not fit in the space allocated on the Loan Estimate, an additional page with that information with respect to real properties may be appended to the end of the form.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-a-7-Interp" id="37-a-7-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(a)(7) Sale price.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-7-Interp-1" id="37-a-7-Interp-1">1. <strong>Estimated property value.</strong> In transactions where there is no seller, such as in a refinancing, §&#160;1026.37(a)(7)(ii) requires the creditor to disclose the estimated value of the property identified in §&#160;1026.37(a)(6) based on the best information reasonably available to the creditor at the time the disclosure is provided to the consumer, which may include, at the creditor's option, the estimated value of the improvements to be made on the property in transactions involving construction. The creditor may use the estimate provided by the consumer at application unless it has performed its own estimate of the property value by the time the disclosure is provided to the consumer, in which case the creditor must use its own estimate. If the creditor has obtained any appraisals or valuations of the property for the application at the time the disclosure is issued to the consumer, the value determined by the appraisal or valuation to be used during underwriting for the application is disclosed as the estimated property value. If the creditor has obtained multiple appraisals or valuations and has not yet determined which one will be used during underwriting, it may disclose the value from any appraisal or valuation it reasonably believes it may use in underwriting the transaction. In a transaction that involves a seller, if the sale price is not yet known, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(a)(7) if it discloses the estimated value of the property that it used as the basis for the disclosures in the Loan Estimate.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-7-Interp-2" id="37-a-7-Interp-2">2. <strong>Personal property.</strong> In transactions involving personal property that is separately valued from real property, only the value of the real property or cooperative unit is disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(a)(7). Where personal property is included in the sale price of the real property or cooperative unit (for example, if the consumer is purchasing the furniture inside the dwelling), however, §&#160;1026.37(a)(7) permits disclosure of the aggregate price without any reduction for the appraised or estimated value of the personal property.</p>

<h3>37(a)(8) Loan term.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-8-Interp-1" id="37-a-8-Interp-1">1. <strong>Partial years.</strong></p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-8-Interp-1-i" id="37-a-8-Interp-1-i">i. <strong>Terms to maturity of 24 months or more.</strong> Section 1026.37(a)(8) requires disclosure of the term to maturity in years, or months, or both, as applicable. Where the term exceeds 24 months and equals a whole number of years, a creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(a)(8) by disclosing the number of years, followed by the designation “years.” Where the term exceeds 24 months but does not equal a whole number of years, a creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(a)(8) by disclosing the term to maturity as the number of years followed by the designation “yr.” and the remaining number of months, followed by the designation “mo.” For example, if the term to maturity of the transaction is 185 months, the correct disclosure would be “15 yr. 5 mo.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-8-Interp-1-ii" id="37-a-8-Interp-1-ii">ii. <strong>Terms to maturity of less than 24 months.</strong> If the term to maturity is less than 24 months and does not equal a whole number of years, a creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(a)(8) by disclosing the number of months only, followed by the designation “mo.” For example, if the term to maturity of a transaction is six months or 16 months, it would be disclosed as “6 mo.” or “16 mo.,” respectively. If the term to maturity is 12 months, however it would be disclosed simply as “1 year.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-8-Interp-2" id="37-a-8-Interp-2">2. <strong>Adjustable loan term.</strong> Section 1026.37(a)(8) requires disclosure of the term to maturity of the credit transaction. If the term to maturity is adjustable, <em>i.e.,</em> it is not known with certainty at consummation, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(a)(8), if it discloses the possible range of the loan term, including the maximum number of years possible under the terms of the legal obligation. For example, if the loan term depends on the value of interest rate adjustments during the term of the loan, to calculate the maximum loan term, the creditor assumes that the interest rate rises as rapidly as possible after consummation, taking into account the terms of the legal obligation, including any applicable caps on interest rate adjustments and lifetime interest rate cap.</p>

<h3>37(a)(9) Purpose.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-9-Interp-1" id="37-a-9-Interp-1">1. <strong>General.</strong> Section 1026.37(a)(9) requires disclosure of the consumer's intended use of the credit. In ascertaining the consumer's intended use, §&#160;1026.37(a)(9) requires the creditor to consider all relevant information known to the creditor at the time of the disclosure. If the purpose is not known, the creditor may rely on the consumer's stated purpose. The following examples illustrate when each of the permissible purposes should be disclosed:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-9-Interp-1-i" id="37-a-9-Interp-1-i">i. <strong>Purchase.</strong> The consumer intends to use the proceeds from the transaction to purchase the property that will secure the extension of credit. In a purchase transaction with simultaneous subordinate financing, the simultaneous subordinate loan is also disclosed with the purpose “Purchase.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-9-Interp-1-ii" id="37-a-9-Interp-1-ii">ii. <strong>Refinance.</strong> The consumer refinances an existing obligation already secured by the consumer's dwelling to change the rate, term, or other loan features and may or may not receive cash from the transaction. For example, in a refinance with no cash provided, the new amount financed does not exceed the unpaid principal balance, any earned unpaid finance charge on the existing debt, and amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. Conversely, in a refinance with cash provided, the consumer refinances an existing mortgage obligation and receives money from the transaction that is in addition to the funds used to pay the unpaid principal balance, any earned unpaid finance charge on the existing debt, and amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. In such a transaction, the consumer may, for example, use the newly-extended credit to pay off the balance of the existing mortgage and other consumer debt, such as a credit card balance.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-9-Interp-1-iii" id="37-a-9-Interp-1-iii">iii. <strong>Construction.</strong> Section 1026.37(a)(9)(iii) requires the creditor to disclose that the loan is for construction in transactions where the creditor extends credit to finance only the cost of initial construction (construction-only loan), not renovations to existing dwellings, and in transactions where a multiple advance loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor (construction-permanent loan). In a construction-only loan, the borrower may be required to make interest-only payments during the loan term with the balance commonly due at the end of the construction project. For additional guidance on disclosing construction-permanent loans, see §&#160;1026.17(c)(6)(ii), comments 17(c)(6)-2, -3, and -5, and appendix D to this part.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-9-Interp-1-iv" id="37-a-9-Interp-1-iv">iv. <strong>Home equity loan.</strong> The creditor is required to disclose that the credit is for a “home equity loan” if the creditor intends to extend credit for any purpose other than a purchase, refinancing, or construction. This disclosure applies whether the loan is secured by a first or subordinate lien.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-9-Interp-2" id="37-a-9-Interp-2">2. <strong>Refinance coverage.</strong> The disclosure requirements under §&#160;1026.37(a)(9)(ii) apply to credit transactions that meet the definition of a refinancing under §&#160;1026.20(a) but without regard to whether they are made by a creditor, holder, or servicer of the existing obligation. Section 1026.20(a) applies only to refinancings undertaken by the original creditor or a holder or servicer of the original debt. <em>See</em> comment 20(a)-5.</p>

<h3>37(a)(10) Product.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-1" id="37-a-10-Interp-1">1. <strong>No features.</strong> If the loan product disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) does not include any of the features described in §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii), only the product type and introductory and first adjustment periods, if applicable, are disclosed. For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-1-i" id="37-a-10-Interp-1-i">i. <strong>Adjustable rate.</strong> When disclosing an adjustable rate product, the disclosure of the loan product must be preceded by the length of the introductory period and the frequency of the first adjustment period thereafter. Thus, for example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory rate that is fixed for the first five years of the loan term and then adjusts every three years starting in year six, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) is “5/3 Adjustable Rate.” If the first adjustment period is not the period for all adjustments under the terms of the legal obligation, the creditor should still disclose the initial adjustment period and should not disclose other adjustment periods. For example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory rate that is fixed for the first five years of the loan term and then adjusts every three years starting in year six, and then annually starting in year fifteen, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) would still be “5/3 Adjustable Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-1-i-A" id="37-a-10-Interp-1-i-A">A. <strong>No introductory period.</strong> If the loan product is an adjustable rate with no introductory rate, the creditor should disclose “0” where the introductory rate period would ordinarily be disclosed. For example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate that adjusts every three years with no introductory period, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) is “0/3 Adjustable Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-1-i-B" id="37-a-10-Interp-1-i-B">B. <strong>Introductory period not yet known.</strong> If the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory period that is not yet known at the time of delivery of the Loan Estimate, the creditor should disclose the shortest potential introductory period for the particular loan product offered. For example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory period that may be between 36 and 48 months and the rate would then adjust every year, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) is “3/1 Adjustable Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-1-ii" id="37-a-10-Interp-1-ii">ii. <strong>Step rate.</strong> If the loan product is a step rate with an introductory interest rate that lasts for ten years and adjusts every year thereafter for the next five years, and then adjusts every three years for the next 15 years, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) is “10/1 Step Rate.” If the loan product is a step rate with no introductory rate, the creditor should disclose “0” where the introductory rate period would ordinarily be disclosed.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-1-iii" id="37-a-10-Interp-1-iii">iii. <strong>Fixed rate.</strong> If the loan product is not an adjustable rate or a step rate, as described in §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(i)(A) and (B), even if an additional feature described in §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii) may change the consumer's periodic payment, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(i) is “Fixed Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-2" id="37-a-10-Interp-2">2. <strong>Additional features.</strong> When disclosing a loan product with at least one of the features described in §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii), §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(iii) and (iv) require the disclosure of only the first applicable feature in the order of §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii) and that it be preceded by the time period or the length of the introductory period and the frequency of the first adjustment period, as applicable, followed by a description of the loan product and its time period as provided for in §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(i). For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-2-i" id="37-a-10-Interp-2-i">i. <strong>Negative amortization.</strong> Some loan products, such as “payment option” loans, permit the borrower to make payments that are insufficient to cover all of the interest accrued, and the unpaid interest is added to the principal balance. Where the loan product includes a loan feature that may cause the loan balance to increase, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(A) is preceded by the time period that the borrower is permitted to make payments that result in negative amortization (<em>e.g.,</em> “2 Year Negative Amortization”), followed by the loan product type. Thus, a fixed rate product with a step-payment feature for the first two years of the legal obligation that may negatively amortize is disclosed as “2 Year Negative Amortization, Fixed Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-2-ii" id="37-a-10-Interp-2-ii">ii. <strong>Interest only.</strong> When disclosing an “Interest Only” feature, as defined in §&#160;1026.18(s)(7)(iv), the applicable time period must precede the label “Interest Only.” Thus, a fixed rate loan with only interest due for the first five years of the loan term is disclosed as “5 Year Interest Only, Fixed Rate.” If the interest only feature fails to cover the total interest due, then, as required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(iii), the disclosure must reference the negative amortization feature and not the interest only feature (<em>e.g.,</em> “5 Year Negative Amortization, Fixed Rate”). See comment app. D-7.ii for an explanation of the disclosure of the time period of an interest only feature for a construction loan or a construction-permanent loan.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-2-iii" id="37-a-10-Interp-2-iii">iii. <strong>Step payment.</strong> When disclosing a step payment feature (which is sometimes referred to instead as a graduated payment), the period of time at the end of which the scheduled payments will change must precede the label “Step Payment” (<em>e.g.,</em> “5 Year Step Payment”) followed by the name of the loan product. Thus, a fixed rate mortgage subject to a 5-year step payment plan is disclosed as a “5 Year Step Payment, Fixed Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-2-iv" id="37-a-10-Interp-2-iv">iv. <strong>Balloon payment.</strong> If a loan product includes a “balloon payment,” as that term is defined in §&#160;1026.37(b)(5), the disclosure of the balloon payment feature, including the year the payment is due, precedes the disclosure of the loan product. Thus, if the loan product is a step rate with an introductory rate that lasts for three years and adjusts each year thereafter until the balloon payment is due in the seventh year of the loan term, the disclosure required is “Year 7 Balloon Payment, 3/1 Step Rate.” If the loan product includes more than one balloon payment, only the earliest year that a balloon payment is due shall be disclosed.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-2-v" id="37-a-10-Interp-2-v">v. <strong>Seasonal payment.</strong> If a loan product includes a seasonal payment feature, §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(E) requires that the creditor disclose the feature. The feature is not, however, required to be disclosed with any preceding time period. Disclosure of the label “Seasonal Payment” without any preceding number of years satisfies this requirement.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-3" id="37-a-10-Interp-3">3. <strong>Periods not in whole years.</strong></p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-3-i" id="37-a-10-Interp-3-i">i. <strong>Terms of 24 months or more.</strong> For product types and features that have introductory periods or adjustment periods that do not equate to a number of whole years, if the period is a number of months that is 24 or greater and does not equate to a whole number of years, §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) requires disclosure of the whole number of years followed by a decimal point with the remaining months rounded to two places. For example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory period of 30 months that adjusts every year thereafter, the creditor would be required to disclose “2.5/1 Adjustable Rate.” If the introductory period were 31 months, the required disclosure would be 2.58/1 Adjustable Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-3-ii" id="37-a-10-Interp-3-ii">ii. <strong>Terms of less than 24 months.</strong> For product types and features that have introductory periods or adjustment periods that do not equate to a number of whole years, if the period is less than 24 months, §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) requires disclosure of the number of months, followed by the designation “mo.” For example, if the product type is an adjustable rate with an 18-month introductory period that adjusts every 18 months starting in the 19th month, the required disclosure would be “18 mo./18mo. Adjustable Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-3-iii" id="37-a-10-Interp-3-iii">iii. <strong>Adjustments more frequent than monthly.</strong> For adjustment periods that change more frequently than monthly, §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) requires disclosure of the applicable unit-period, such as daily, weekly, or bi-weekly. For example, for an adjustable rate construction loan with no introductory fixed rate period where the interest rate adjusts every seven days, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) is “0/Weekly Adjustable Rate.”</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-a-11-Interp" id="37-a-11-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(a)(11) Loan type.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-11-Interp-1" id="37-a-11-Interp-1">1. <strong>Other.</strong> If the transaction is a type other than a conventional, FHA, or VA loan, §&#160;1026.37(a)(11)(iv) requires the creditor to disclose the loan type as “Other” and provide a name or brief description of the loan type. For example, a loan that is guaranteed or funded by the Federal government under the Rural Housing Service (RHS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture is required to be disclosed under the subcategory “Other.” Section 1026.37(a)(11)(iv) requires a brief description of the loan type (<em>e.g.,</em> “RHS”). A loan that is insured or guaranteed by a State agency must also be disclosed as “Other.”</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-a-12-Interp" id="37-a-12-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(a)(12) Loan identification number (Loan ID # ).</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-12-Interp-1" id="37-a-12-Interp-1">1. <strong>Unique identifier.</strong> Section 1026.37(a)(12) requires that the creditor disclose a loan identification number that may be used by the creditor, consumer, and other parties to identify the transaction, labeled as “Loan ID # .” The loan identification number is determined by the creditor, which number may contain any alpha-numeric characters. Because the number must allow for the identification of the particular credit transaction under §&#160;1026.37(a)(12), a creditor must use a unique loan identification number, <em>i.e.,</em> the creditor may not use the same loan identification number for different, but related, loan transactions (such as different loans to the same borrower). Where a creditor issues a revised Loan Estimate for a transaction, the loan identification number must be sufficient to enable identification of the transaction pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(a)(12).</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-a-13-Interp" id="37-a-13-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(a)(13) Rate lock.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-13-Interp-1" id="37-a-13-Interp-1">1. <strong>Interest rate.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.37(a)(13), the interest rate is locked for a specific period of time if the creditor has agreed to extend credit to the consumer at a given rate, subject to contingencies that are described in any rate lock agreement between the creditor and consumer.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-13-Interp-2" id="37-a-13-Interp-2">2. <strong>Expiration date.</strong> The disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(13)(ii) related to estimated closing costs is required regardless of whether the interest rate is locked for a specific period of time or whether the terms and costs are otherwise accepted or extended. If the consumer fails to indicate an intent to proceed with the transaction within 10 business days after the disclosures were originally provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iii) (or within any longer time period established by the creditor), then, for determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), a creditor may use a revised estimate of a charge instead of the amount originally disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i). <em>See</em> comment 19(e)(3)(iv)(E)-2.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-13-Interp-3" id="37-a-13-Interp-3">3. <strong>Time zone.</strong> The disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(13) requires the applicable time zone for all times provided, as determined by the creditor. For example, if the creditor is located in New York and determines that the Loan Estimate will expire at 5:00 p.m. in the time zone applicable to its location, while standard time is in effect, the disclosure must include a reference to the Eastern time zone (<em>i.e.,</em> 5:00 p.m. EST).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-13-Interp-4" id="37-a-13-Interp-4">4. <strong>Revised disclosures.</strong> Once the consumer indicates an intent to proceed within the time specified by the creditor under §&#160;1026.37(a)(13)(ii), the date and time at which estimated closing costs expire are left blank on any subsequent revised disclosures. The creditor may extend the period of availability to expire beyond the time disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(a)(13)(ii). If the consumer indicates an intent to proceed within that longer time period, the date and time at which estimated closing costs expire are left blank on subsequent revised disclosures, if any. <em>See</em> comment 19(e)(3)(iv)-5.</p>

<h3>37(b) Loan terms.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-Interp-1" id="37-b-Interp-1">1. <strong>Legal obligation.</strong> The disclosures required by §&#160;1026.37 must reflect good faith estimates of the credit terms to which the parties will be legally bound for the transaction. Accordingly, if certain terms of the transaction are known or reasonably available to the creditor, based on information such as the consumer's selection of a product type or other information in the consumer's application, §&#160;1026.37 requires the creditor to disclose those credit terms. For example, if the consumer selects a product type with a prepayment penalty, §&#160;1026.37(b)(4) requires disclosure of the maximum amount of the prepayment penalty and period in which the prepayment penalty may be charged as known to the creditor at the time the disclosures are provided.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-b-2-Interp" id="37-b-2-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(b)(2) Interest rate.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-2-Interp-1" id="37-b-2-Interp-1">1. <strong>Interest rate at consummation not known.</strong> Where the interest rate that will apply at consummation is not known at the time the creditor must deliver the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e), §&#160;1026.37(b)(2) requires disclosure of the fully-indexed rate, defined as the index plus the margin at consummation. Although §&#160;1026.37(b)(2) refers to the index plus margin “at consummation,” if the index value that will be in effect at consummation is unknown at the time the disclosures are provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iii), <em>i.e.,</em> within three business days after receipt of a consumer's application, the fully-indexed rate disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(b)(2) may be based on the index in effect at the time the disclosure is delivered. The index in effect at consummation (or the time the disclosure is delivered under §&#160;1026.19(e)) need not be used if the contract provides for a delay in the implementation of changes in an index value. For example, if the contract specifies that rate changes are based on the index value in effect 45 days before the change date, creditors may use any index value in effect during the 45 days before consummation (or any earlier date of disclosure) in calculating the fully-indexed rate to be disclosed. See comment app. D-7.iii for an explanation of the disclosure of the permanent financing interest rate for a construction-permanent loan.</p>

<h3>37(b)(3) Principal and interest payment.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-3-Interp-1" id="37-b-3-Interp-1">1. <strong>Frequency of principal and interest payment.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(o)(5)(i), if the contract provides for a unit-period, as defined in appendix J to this part, of a month, such as a monthly payment schedule, the payment disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(b)(3) should be labeled “Monthly Principal &amp; Interest.” If the contract requires bi-weekly payments of principal or interest, the payment should be labeled “Bi-Weekly Principal &amp; Interest.” If a creditor voluntarily permits a payment schedule not provided for in the contract, such as an informal principal-reduction arrangement, the disclosure should reflect only the payment frequency provided for in the contract. <em>See</em> §&#160;1026.17(c)(1).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-3-Interp-2" id="37-b-3-Interp-2">2. <strong>Initial periodic payment if not known.</strong> Under §&#160;1026.37(b)(3), the initial periodic payment amount that will be due under the terms of the legal obligation must be disclosed. If the initial periodic payment is not known because it will be based on an interest rate at consummation that is not known at the time the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.19(e) must be provided, for example, if it is based on an external index that may fluctuate before consummation, §&#160;1026.37(b)(3) requires that the disclosure be based on the fully-indexed rate disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(b)(2). See comment 37(b)(2)-1 for guidance regarding calculating the fully-indexed rate.</p>

<h3>37(b)(4) Prepayment penalty.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-1" id="37-b-4-Interp-1">1. <strong>Transaction includes a prepayment penalty.</strong> Section 1026.37(b)(4) requires disclosure of a statement of whether the transaction includes a prepayment penalty. If the transaction includes a prepayment penalty, §&#160;1026.37(b)(7) sets forth the information that must be disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(b)(4) (<em>i.e.,</em> the maximum amount of the prepayment penalty that may be imposed under the terms of the loan contract and the date on which the penalty will no longer be imposed). For an example of such disclosure, see form H-24 of appendix H to this part. The disclosure under §&#160;1026.37(b)(4) applies to transactions where the terms of the loan contract provide for a prepayment penalty, even though the creditor does not know at the time of the disclosure whether the consumer will, in fact, make a payment to the creditor that would cause imposition of the penalty. For example, if the monthly interest accrual amortization method described in comment 37(b)(4)-2.i is used such that interest is assessed on the balance for a full month even if the consumer makes a full prepayment before the end of the month, the transaction includes a prepayment penalty that must be disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(b)(4).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-2" id="37-b-4-Interp-2">2. <strong>Examples of prepayment penalties.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.37(b)(4), the following are examples of prepayment penalties:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-2-i" id="37-b-4-Interp-2-i">i. A charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest rate to such “balance,” even if the charge results from interest accrual amortization used for other payments in the transaction under the terms of the loan contract. “Interest accrual amortization” refers to the method by which the amount of interest due for each period (<strong>e.g.,</strong> month) in a transaction's term is determined. For example, “monthly interest accrual amortization” treats each payment as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late (until the expiration of any grace period). Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the consumer prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-2-ii" id="37-b-4-Interp-2-ii">ii. A fee, such as an origination or other loan closing cost, that is waived by the creditor on the condition that the consumer does not prepay the loan. See comment 37(b)(4)-3.iii below for additional guidance regarding waived bona fide third-party charges imposed by the creditor if the consumer pays all of a covered transaction's principal before the date on which the principal is due sooner than 36 months after consummation.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-2-iii" id="37-b-4-Interp-2-iii">iii. A minimum finance charge in a simple interest transaction.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-2-iv" id="37-b-4-Interp-2-iv">iv. Computing a refund of unearned interest by a method that is less favorable to the consumer than the actuarial method, as defined by section 933(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, 15 U.S.C. 1615(d). For purposes of computing a refund of unearned interest, if using the actuarial method defined by applicable State law results in a refund that is greater than the refund calculated by using the method described in section 933(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, creditors should use the State law definition in determining if a refund is a prepayment penalty.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-3" id="37-b-4-Interp-3">3. <strong>Fees that are not prepayment penalties.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.37(b)(4), fees that are not prepayment penalties include, for example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-3-i" id="37-b-4-Interp-3-i">i. Fees imposed for preparing and providing documents when a loan is paid in full, if such fees are imposed whether or not the loan is prepaid. Examples include a loan payoff statement, a reconveyance document, or another document releasing the creditor's security interest in the dwelling that secures the loan.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-3-ii" id="37-b-4-Interp-3-ii">ii. Loan guarantee fees.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-3-iii" id="37-b-4-Interp-3-iii">iii. A waived bona fide third-party charge imposed by the creditor if the consumer pays all of a covered transaction's principal before the date on which the principal is due sooner than 36 months after consummation. For example, assume that at consummation, the creditor waives $3,000 in closing costs to cover bona fide third-party charges but the terms of the loan agreement provide that the creditor may recoup the $3,000 in waived charges if the consumer repays the entire loan balance sooner than 36 months after consummation. The $3,000 charge is not a prepayment penalty. In contrast, for example, assume that at consummation, the creditor waives $3,000 in closing costs to cover bona fide third-party charges but the terms of the loan agreement provide that the creditor may recoup $4,500 in part to recoup waived charges, if the consumer repays the entire loan balance sooner than 36 months after consummation. The $3,000 that the creditor may impose to cover the waived bona fide third-party charges is not a prepayment penalty, but the additional $1,500 charge is a prepayment penalty and must be disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(b)(4).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-4" id="37-b-4-Interp-4">4. <strong>Rebate of finance charge.</strong> For an obligation that includes a finance charge that does not take into account each reduction in the principal balance of the obligation, the disclosure under §&#160;1026.37(b)(4) reflects whether or not the consumer is entitled to a rebate of any finance charge if the obligation is prepaid in full or part. Finance charges that do not take into account each reduction in the principal balance of an obligation may include precomputed finance charges. If any portion of an unearned precomputed finance charge will not be provided as a rebate upon full prepayment, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(b)(4) will be an affirmative answer, indicate the maximum amount of such precomputed finance charge that may not be provided as a rebate to the consumer upon any prepayment, and state when the period during which a full rebate would not be provided terminates, as required by §&#160;1026.37(b)(7). If, instead, there will be a full rebate of the precomputed finance charge and no other prepayment penalty imposed on the consumer, to comply with the requirements of §&#160;1026.37(b)(4) and (7), the creditor states a negative answer only. If the transaction involves both a precomputed finance charge and a finance charge computed by application of a rate to an unpaid balance, disclosure about both the entitlement to any rebate of the finance charge upon prepayment and any other prepayment penalty are made as one disclosure under §&#160;1026.37(b)(4), stating one affirmative or negative answer and an aggregated amount and time period for the information required by §&#160;1026.37(b)(7). For example, if in such a transaction, a portion of the precomputed finance charge will not be provided as a rebate and the loan contract also provides for a prepayment penalty based on the amount prepaid, both disclosures are made under §&#160;1026.37(b)(4) as one aggregate amount, stating the maximum amount and time period under §&#160;1026.37(b)(7). If the transaction instead provides a rebate of the precomputed finance charge upon prepayment, but imposes a prepayment penalty based on the amount prepaid, to comply with §&#160;1026.37(b)(4), the creditor states an affirmative answer and the information about the prepayment penalty, as required by §&#160;1026.37(b)(7).

<h3>37(b)(5) Balloon payment.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-5-Interp-1" id="37-b-5-Interp-1">1. <strong>Regular periodic payment.</strong> If a payment is not itself a regular periodic payment and is more than two times any one regular periodic payment during the loan term, then it is disclosed as a balloon payment under §&#160;1026.37(b)(5). The regular periodic payments used to determine whether a payment is a balloon payment under §&#160;1026.37(b)(5) are the payments of principal and interest (or interest only, depending on the loan features) specified under the terms of the loan contract that are due from the consumer for two or more unit-periods in succession. All regular periodic payments during the loan term are used to determine whether a particular payment is a balloon payment, regardless of whether the regular periodic payments have changed during the loan term due to rate adjustments or other payment changes permitted or required under the loan contract.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-5-Interp-1-i" id="37-b-5-Interp-1-i">i. For example, assume that, under a 15-year step rate mortgage, the loan contract provides for scheduled monthly payments of $300 each during the years one through three and scheduled monthly payments of $700 each during years four through 15. If an irregular payment of $1,000 is scheduled during the final month of year 15, that payment is disclosed as a balloon payment under §&#160;1026.37(b)(5), because it is more than two times the regular periodic payment amount of $300 during years one through three. This is the case even though the irregular payment is not more than two times the regular periodic payment of $700 per month during years four through fifteen. The $700 monthly payments during years four through fifteen are not balloon payments even though they are more than two times the regular periodic payments during years one through three, because they are regular periodic payments.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-5-Interp-1-ii" id="37-b-5-Interp-1-ii">ii. If the loan has an adjustable rate under which the regular periodic payments may increase after consummation, but the amounts of such payment increases (if any) are unknown at the time of consummation, then the regular periodic payments are based on the fully-indexed rate, except as otherwise determined by any premium or discounted rates, the application of any interest rate adjustment caps, or any other known, scheduled rates under the terms specified in the loan contract. For analogous guidance, see comments 17(c)(1)-8 and -10. Similarly, if a loan has an adjustable interest rate which does not adjust the regular periodic payment but would, if the rate increased, increase only the final payment, the amount of the final payment for purposes of the balloon payment determination is based on the fully-indexed rate, except as otherwise determined by any premium or discounted rate caps, or any other known, scheduled rates under the terms specified in the loan contract. For example, assume that, under a 30-year adjustable rate mortgage, (1) the loan contract requires monthly payments of $300 during years one through five, (2) the loan contract permits interest rate increases every three years starting in the sixth year up to the fully-indexed rate, subject to caps on interest rate adjustments specified in the loan contract, (3) based on the application of the interest rate adjustment caps, the interest rate may increase to the fully-indexed rate starting in year nine, and (4) the monthly payment based on the fully-indexed rate is $700. The regular periodic payments during years one through five are $300 per month, because they are known and scheduled. The regular periodic payments during years six through eight are up to $700 per month, based on the fully-indexed rate but subject to the application of interest rate adjustment caps specified under the loan contract. The regular periodic payments during years nine through thirty are $700, based on the fully-indexed rate. Therefore, if an irregular payment of $1,000 is scheduled during the final month of year 30, that payment is disclosed as a balloon payment under §&#160;1026.37(b)(5), because it is more than two times the regular periodic payment amount of $300 during years one through five. This is the case even though the irregular payment is not more than two times the regular periodic payment during years nine through thirty (<strong>i.e.,</strong> based on the fully-indexed rate). However, the regular periodic payments during years six through thirty themselves are not balloon payments, even though they may be more than two times the regular periodic payments during years one through five.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-5-Interp-1-iii" id="37-b-5-Interp-1-iii">iii. For a loan with a negative amortization feature, the regular periodic payment does not take into account the possibility that the consumer may exercise an option to make a payment greater than the scheduled periodic payment specified under the terms of the loan contract, if any.</p>

Accordingly, where the periodic principal and interest payment may change because of more than one factor and such adjustments are on different schedules, the frequency disclosed is the adjustment of whichever factor adjusts first. For example, where the interest rate for a transaction is fixed until year six and then adjusts every three years but the transaction also has a negative amortization feature that ends in year seven, §&#160;1026.37(b)(6)(iii) requires disclosure that the interest rate will adjust every three years starting in year six because the periodic principal and interest payment adjusts based on the interest rate before it adjusts based on the end of the negative amortization period.</p>

The creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(b)(7)(i) when it assumes that the consumer prepays at a time when the prepayment penalty may be charged and that the consumer makes all payments prior to the prepayment on a timely basis and in the amount required by the terms of the legal obligation. The creditor must determine the maximum of each amount used in calculating the prepayment penalty. For example, if a transaction is fully amortizing and the prepayment penalty is two percent of the loan balance at the time of prepayment, the prepayment penalty amount should be determined by using the highest loan balance possible during the period in which the penalty may be imposed. If more than one type of prepayment penalty applies, the creditor must aggregate the maximum amount of each type of prepayment penalty in the maximum penalty disclosed.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-i-A-Interp-1" id="37-c-1-i-A-Interp-1">1. <strong>Periodic principal and interest payments.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A), periodic principal and interest payments may change when the interest rate, applicable interest rate caps, required periodic principal and interest payments, or ranges of such payments may change. Minor payment variations resulting solely from the fact that months have different numbers of days are not changes to periodic principal and interest payments.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-i-A-Interp-2" id="37-c-1-i-A-Interp-2">2. <strong>Negative amortization.</strong> In a loan that contains a negative amortization feature, periodic principal and interest payments or the range of such payments may change for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) at the time the negative amortization period ends under the terms of the legal obligation, meaning the consumer must begin making payments that do not result in an increase of the principal balance. The occurrence of an event requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges of payments should be based on the assumption that the consumer will make payments as scheduled or, if applicable, elect to make the periodic payments that would extend the negative amortization period to the latest time permitted under the terms of the legal obligation. The occurrence of all subsequent events requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges of payments should be based on this assumption. The table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) should also reflect any balloon payment that would result from such scheduled payments or election. See §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(ii)(A) for special rules regarding disclosure of balloon payments.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-i-A-Interp-3" id="37-c-1-i-A-Interp-3">3. <strong>Interest only.</strong> In a loan that contains an interest only feature, periodic principal and interest payments may change for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) when the interest only period ends, meaning the consumer must begin making payments that do not defer repayment of principal.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 37(c)(1)(i)(C).</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-i-C-Interp-1" id="37-c-1-i-C-Interp-1">1. <strong>General.</strong> “Mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent” means the amounts identified in §&#160;1026.4(b)(5). For purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c), “mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent” includes any mortgage guarantee that provides coverage similar to mortgage insurance (such as a United States Department of Veterans Affairs or United States Department of Agriculture guarantee), even if not technically considered insurance under State or other applicable law. The fees for such a guarantee are included in “mortgage insurance premiums.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-i-C-Interp-2" id="37-c-1-i-C-Interp-2">2. <strong>Calculation of mortgage insurance termination.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(C), mortgage insurance premiums should be calculated based on the declining principal balance that will occur as a result of changes to the interest rate and payment amounts, applying the interest rates applicable to the transaction. Such calculation should take into account any initial discounted or premium interest rate. For example, for an adjustable rate transaction that has a discounted interest rate during an initial five-year period, the creditor makes the calculation using a composite rate based on the rate in effect during the initial five-year period and, thereafter, the fully-indexed rate, unless otherwise required by applicable law. For guidance on calculation of the amount of mortgage insurance premiums to disclose on the table required by §&#160;1026.37(c), see §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(ii) and its commentary. See comment 37(b)(2)-1 for guidance regarding calculating the fully-indexed rate.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-i-C-Interp-3" id="37-c-1-i-C-Interp-3">3. <strong>Disclosure of mortgage insurance termination.</strong> The table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) should reflect the consumer's mortgage insurance premiums until the date on which the creditor must automatically terminate coverage under applicable law, even though the consumer may have a right to request that the insurance be cancelled earlier. Unlike termination of mortgage insurance, a subsequent decline in the consumer's mortgage insurance premiums is not, by itself, an event that requires the disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges of payments in the table required by §&#160;1026.37(c). For example, some mortgage insurance programs annually adjust premiums based on the declining loan balance. Such annual adjustment to the amount of premiums would not require a separate disclosure of a periodic payment or range payments.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-ii-A-Interp-1" id="37-c-1-ii-A-Interp-1">1. <strong>Special rule regarding balloon payments that are final payments.</strong> Section 1026.37(c)(1)(ii)(A) is an exception to the general rule in §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(ii), and requires that a balloon payment that is scheduled as a final payment under the terms of the legal obligation is always disclosed as a separate periodic payment or range of payments, in which case the creditor discloses as a single range of payments all events requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges of payments described in §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) through (D), other than the final balloon payment, occurring after the second separate periodic payment or range of payments disclosed. Balloon payments that are not scheduled as final payments under the terms of the legal obligation, such as a balloon payment due at the scheduled recast of a loan that permits negative amortization, are disclosed pursuant to the general rule in §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(ii). A balloon payment that is a final payment is disclosed as a single payment, and not combined with other changes to periodic principal and interest payments and disclosed as a range.</p>

The creditor discloses on the table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) in the first column the initial periodic payment or range of payments, in the second column the periodic payment or range of payments that would apply after the first interest rate adjustment, in the third column the periodic payments or ranges of payments that would apply after the second interest rate adjustment until the final balloon payment (disclosed as a single range of payments), and in the fourth column the final balloon payment. Although the balloon payment that is scheduled as the final payment under the terms of the legal obligation occurs after the third separate periodic payment or range of payments, the creditor discloses the final balloon payment as a separate event requiring disclosure of additional periodic payments or range of payments due to the special rule in §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(ii)(A).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-ii-B-Interp-1" id="37-c-1-ii-B-Interp-1">1. <strong>Special rule regarding disclosure of the automatic termination of mortgage insurance.</strong> Section 1026.37(c)(1)(ii)(B) is an exception to the general rule in §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(ii), and requires that the automatic termination of mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent under applicable law is disclosed as a separate periodic payment or range of payments only if the total number of separate periodic payments or ranges of payments otherwise disclosed does not exceed three. This means that the automatic termination of mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent under applicable law is disclosed as its own event only if there is a column in which to disclose it, <em>i.e.,</em> there are only three other separate periodic payments or ranges of payments that are required to be disclosed. Where the automatic termination of mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent under applicable law is not disclosed as a separate periodic payment or range of payments, the absence of a required mortgage insurance payment is disclosed with the next disclosed event requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges of payments, as applicable.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-ii-B-Interp-2" id="37-c-1-ii-B-Interp-2">2. <strong>Examples of special rule regarding disclosure of the automatic termination of mortgage insurance.</strong> i. Assume a step-rate loan with a 30-year term with an introductory interest rate that lasts for five years, a different interest rate that applies for the next five-year period, a final interest rate adjustment after 10 years, where mortgage insurance would terminate for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(C) in the third year, and where no escrow account would be established for the payment of charges described in §&#160;1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The creditor would disclose on the table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) the initial periodic payment for years one through three (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the introductory interest rate and payments for mortgage insurance premiums), an additional separate periodic payment for years four and five (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the introductory rate and no payments for mortgage insurance premiums), an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments for years six through 10 (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the interest rate that would apply after the introductory rate), and an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments for years 11 through 30 (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the interest rate that would apply after the second interest rate adjustment until the end of the loan term). In this example, the automatic termination of mortgage insurance would be separately disclosed on the table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) because the total number of separate periodic payments or ranges of payments otherwise disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(c)(1) does not exceed three.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-ii-B-Interp-ii" id="37-c-1-ii-B-Interp-ii">ii. Assume the same loan as above, except that the terms of the legal obligation also provide for a third interest rate adjustment that would occur after 15 years. The creditor would disclose on the table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) the initial periodic payment for years one through five (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the introductory interest rate and payments for mortgage insurance premiums), an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments for years six through 10 (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the interest rate that would apply after the first interest rate adjustment and no payments for mortgage insurance premiums), an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments for years 11 through 15 (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the interest rate that would apply after the second interest rate adjustment), and an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments for years 16 through 30 (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the interest rate that would apply after the third interest rate adjustment until the end of the loan term). In this example, the automatic termination of mortgage insurance would not be separately disclosed on the table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) because the total number of separate periodic payments or ranges of payments otherwise disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(c)(1) exceeds three. However, the creditor would disclose the termination of mortgage insurance beginning with the periodic payment or range of payments for years six through 10, which is the next disclosed event requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges of payments.</p>

The amount required to be disclosed for mortgage insurance premiums pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(ii) and the amount payable into an escrow account pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(iii) shall not be disclosed as a range.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1" id="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1">1. <strong>Multiple events occurring in a single year.</strong> If multiple changes to periodic principal and interest payments would result in more than one separate periodic payment or range of payments in a single year, §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(iii)(B) requires the creditor to disclose the range of payments that would apply during the year in which the events occur. For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1-i" id="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1-i">i. Assume a loan with a 30-year term with a payment that adjusts every month for the first 12 months and is fixed thereafter, where mortgage insurance is not required, and where no escrow account would be established for the payment of charges described in §&#160;1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The creditor discloses as a single range of payments the initial periodic payment and the periodic payment that would apply after each payment adjustment during the first 12 months, which single range represents the minimum payment and maximum payment, respectively. Under §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D), the creditor also discloses, as an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments, the periodic principal and interest payment or range of payments that would apply after the payment becomes fixed.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1-ii" id="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1-ii">ii. Assume instead a loan with a 30-year term with a payment that adjusts upward at three months and at six months and is fixed thereafter, where mortgage insurance is not required, and where no escrow account would be established for the payment of charges described in §&#160;1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The creditor discloses as a single range of payments the initial periodic payment, the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at three months, and the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at six months, which single range represents the minimum payment and maximum payment, respectively, which would apply during the first year of the loan. Under §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D), the creditor also discloses as an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments, the principal and interest payment that would apply on the first anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment or range of payments, because that is the anniversary that immediately follows the occurrence of the multiple payments or ranges of payments that occurred during the first year of the loan.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1-iii" id="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1-iii">iii. Assume that the same loan has a payment that, instead of becoming fixed after the adjustment at six months, adjusts once more at 18 months and becomes fixed thereafter. The creditor discloses the same single range of payments for year one. Under §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D), the creditor separately discloses the principal and interest payment that would apply on the first anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment in year two. Under §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) and (c)(3)(ii), beginning in the next year in the sequence (<strong>i.e.,</strong> in year three), the creditor separately discloses the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at 18 months.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-2-i-Interp-1" id="37-c-2-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>General rule for adjustable rate loans.</strong> For an adjustable rate loan, in disclosing the maximum possible payment for principal and interest under §&#160;1026.37(c), the creditor assumes that the interest rate will rise as rapidly as possible after consummation, taking into account the terms of the legal obligation, including any applicable caps on interest rate adjustments and lifetime interest rate cap. For a loan with no lifetime interest rate cap, the maximum rate is determined by reference to other applicable laws, such as State usury law. In disclosing the minimum payment for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c), the creditor assumes that the interest rate will decrease as rapidly as possible after consummation, taking into account any introductory rates, caps on interest rate adjustments, and lifetime interest rate floor. For an adjustable rate loan based on an index that has no lifetime interest rate floor, the minimum interest rate is equal to the margin.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-2-i-Interp-2" id="37-c-2-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>Special rule for adjustable rate loans with negative amortization features.</strong> Section 1026.37(c)(2)(i)(B) provides a special rule for calculation of the maximum principal and interest payment in an adjustable rate loan that contains a negative amortization feature. That section provides that the maximum amounts payable for principal and interest after the negative amortization period ends are calculated using the maximum principal amount permitted under the terms of the legal obligation at the end of the negative amortization period. See section §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) and associated commentary for guidance regarding when the negative amortization period ends for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c)(2). For example, if the maximum principal balance for the last payment in the negative amortization period is achieved at an interest rate that is not the maximum interest rate permitted under the terms of the legal obligation before the negative amortization period ends, future events requiring disclosure of additional, separate periodic payments or ranges of payments assume that the interest rate in effect at the end of the negative amortization period was such interest rate, and not the maximum possible interest rate. After the end of the negative amortization period, the general rule under §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i)(A) regarding assumptions of interest rate changes for the maximum principal and interest payment to be disclosed applies from such interest rate. The minimum payment in an adjustable rate loan that contains a negative amortization feature is determined pursuant to the general rule under §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i)(A).</p>

For example, for a balloon payment amount that can change depending on previous interest rate adjustments that are based on the value of an index at the time of the adjustment, the balloon payment amounts are calculated using the assumptions for minimum and maximum interest rates described in §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i) and its commentary, and should be disclosed as a range of payments.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-3-ii-Interp-1" id="37-c-3-ii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Years.</strong> Section 1026.37(c)(3)(ii) requires that each separate periodic payment or range of payments be disclosed under a subheading that states the years during which that payment or range of payments will apply and that such subheadings be stated in a sequence of whole years from the due date of the initial periodic payment. Therefore, for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c), “year” is defined as the twelve-month interval beginning on the due date of the initial periodic payment, and the next whole year begins each anniversary thereafter. If an event requiring the disclosure of an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments occurs on a date other than the anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment, and no other events occur during that single year requiring disclosure of multiple events under §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(iii)(B), such event is disclosed beginning in the next year in the sequence, because the separate periodic payment or range of payments that applied during the previous year will also apply during a portion of that year. For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-c-3-ii-Interp-1-i" id="37-c-3-ii-Interp-1-i">i. Assume a fixed rate loan with a term of 124 months (10 years, four months). The creditor would label the disclosure of periodic payments as “Years 1-11.”</p>

Assume a loan with a 30-year term that does not require mortgage insurance and requires interest only payments for the first 60 months from the due date of the initial periodic payment, then requires fixed, fully amortizing payments of principal and interest beginning at the 61st month for the duration of the loan, the creditor would label the first disclosure of periodic payments as “Years 1-5” (including the term “only interest” pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i)) and the second disclosure of periodic payments or range of payments as “Years 6-30.” If that loan requires interest only payments for the first 54 months from the due date of the initial periodic payment, then requires fixed, fully amortizing payments of principal and interest for the duration of the loan, because the change in the periodic payment occurs on a date other than the anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment and the previous payment applies during that year, the creditor would likewise label the first disclosure of periodic payments as “Years 1-5” (including the term “only interest” pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i)) and the second disclosure of periodic payments or range of payments as “Years 6-30.” If the loan that requires interest only payments for the first 54 months also requires mortgage insurance that would automatically terminate under applicable law after the 100th month from the due date of the initial periodic payment, the creditor would label the first disclosure of periodic payments as “Years 1-5” (including the term “only interest” pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i)), the second disclosure of periodic payments or range of payments as “Years 6-9,” and the third disclosure of periodic payments or range of payments as “Years 10-30.”</p>

To calculate the maximum loan term, the creditor assumes that the interest rate rises as rapidly as possible, taking into account the terms of the legal obligation, including any applicable caps on interest rate adjustments and lifetime interest rate cap. <em>See</em> comment 37(a)(8)-2.</p>

If inspection and handling fees are collected at or before consummation, the total of such fees is disclosed in the loan costs table. If inspection and handling fees will be collected after consummation, the total of such fees is disclosed in a separate addendum and the fees are not counted for purposes of the calculating cash to close table.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-f-1-Interp-1" id="37-f-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Origination charges.</strong> Charges included under the subheading “Origination Charges” pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(f)(1) are those charges paid by the consumer to each creditor and loan originator for originating and extending the credit, regardless of how such fees are denominated. In accordance with §&#160;1026.37(o)(4), the dollar amounts disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(f)(1) must be rounded to the nearest whole dollar and the percentage amounts must be disclosed as an exact number up to two or three decimal places, except that decimal places shall not be disclosed if the percentage is a whole number. See comment 19(e)(3)(i)-3 for a discussion of when a fee is considered to be “paid to” a person. See §&#160;1026.36(a) and associated commentary for a discussion of the meaning of “loan originator” in connection with limits on compensation in a consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-f-1-Interp-2" id="37-f-1-Interp-2">2. <strong>Indirect loan originator compensation.</strong> Only charges paid directly by the consumer to compensate a loan originator are included in the amounts listed under §&#160;1026.37(f)(1). Compensation of a loan originator paid indirectly by the creditor through the interest rate is not itemized on the Loan Estimate required by §&#160;1026.19(e). However, pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(f)(1), such compensation is itemized on the Closing Disclosure required by §&#160;1026.19(f).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-f-1-Interp-3" id="37-f-1-Interp-3">3. <strong>Description of charges.</strong> Other than for points charged in connection with the transaction to reduce the interest rate, for which specific language must be used, the creditor may use a general label that uses terminology that, under §&#160;1026.37(f)(5), is consistent with §&#160;1026.17(a)(1), clearly and conspicuously describes the service that is disclosed as an origination charge pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(f)(1). Items that are listed under the subheading “Origination Charges” may include, for example, application fee, origination fee, underwriting fee, processing fee, verification fee, and rate-lock fee.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-f-1-Interp-4" id="37-f-1-Interp-4">4. <strong>Points.</strong> If there are no points charged in connection with the transaction to reduce the interest rate, the creditor leaves blank the percentage of points used in the label and the dollar amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(f)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-f-1-Interp-5" id="37-f-1-Interp-5">5. <strong>Itemization.</strong> Creditors determine the level of itemization of “Origination Charges” that is appropriate under §&#160;1026.37(f)(1) in relation to charges paid by the consumer to the creditor, subject to the limitations in §&#160;1026.37(f)(1)(ii). For example, the following charges should be itemized separately: compensation paid directly by a consumer to a loan originator that is not also the creditor; or a charge imposed to pay for a loan level pricing adjustment assessed on the creditor, which the creditor passes onto the consumer as a charge at consummation and not as an adjustment to the interest rate.</p>

Comment 19(e)(1)(vi)-1 clarifies that a consumer is not permitted to shop if the consumer must choose a provider from a list provided by the creditor. Comment 19(e)(3)(i)-1 addresses determining good faith in providing estimates under §&#160;1026.19(e), including estimates for services for which the consumer cannot shop. Comments 19(e)(3)(iv)-1 through -3 discuss limits and requirements applicable to providing revised estimates for services for which the consumer cannot shop.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-f-2-Interp-2" id="37-f-2-Interp-2">2. <strong>Examples of charges.</strong> Examples of the services and amounts to be disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(f)(2) might include an appraisal fee, appraisal management company fee, credit report fee, flood determination fee, government funding fee, homeowner's association certification fee, lender's attorney fee, tax status research fee, third-party subordination fee, title - closing protection letter fee, title - lender's title insurance policy, and an upfront mortgage insurance fee, provided that the fee is charged at consummation and is not a prepayment of future premiums over a specific future time period or a payment into an escrow account. Government funding fees include a United States Department of Veterans Affairs or United States Department of Agriculture guarantee fee, or any other fee paid to a government entity as part of a governmental loan program, that is paid at consummation.</p>

These services may include, for example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-f-2-Interp-3-i" id="37-f-2-Interp-3-i">i. Examination and evaluation, based on relevant law and title insurance underwriting principles and guidelines, of the title evidence to determine the insurability of the title being examined and what items to include or exclude in any title commitment and policy to be issued;</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-f-2-Interp-3-ii" id="37-f-2-Interp-3-ii">ii.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-f-2-Interp-4" id="37-f-2-Interp-4">4. <strong>Lender's title insurance policy.</strong> Section 1026.37(f)(2) and (3) requires disclosure of the amount the consumer will pay for the lender's title insurance policy. However, an owner's title insurance policy that covers the consumer and is not required to be purchased by the creditor is only disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g). Accordingly, the creditor must quote the amount of the lender's title insurance coverage pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(f)(2) or (3) as applicable based on the type of lender's title insurance policy required by its underwriting standards for that loan. The amount disclosed for the lender's title insurance policy pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(f)(2) or (3) is the amount of the premium without any adjustment that might be made for the simultaneous purchase of an owner's title insurance policy. This amount may be disclosed as “Title - Premium for Lender's Coverage,” or in any similar manner that clearly indicates the amount of the premium disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(f)(2) is for the lender's title insurance coverage. See comment 37(g)(4)-1 for a discussion of the disclosure of the premium for an owner's title insurance policy that covers the consumer.</p>

A creditor complies with this requirement if it uses terminology that is clear and conspicuous, consistent with §&#160;1026.17(a)(1), and describes the service or administrative function that the charge pays for in a manner that is reasonably understood by consumers within the space provided in form H-24 of appendix H to this part. For example, if a creditor imposes a fee on a consumer to cover the costs associated with underwriting the transaction, the creditor would comply with §&#160;1026.37(f)(5) if it labeled the cost “Underwriting Fee.” A label that uses abbreviations or acronyms that are not reasonably understood by consumers would not comply with §&#160;1026.37(f)(5).</p>

<h3>37(g) Closing cost details; other costs.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-Interp-1" id="37-g-Interp-1">1. <strong>General description.</strong> The items listed under the heading of “Other Costs” pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g) include services that are ancillary to the creditor's decision to evaluate the collateral and the consumer for the loan. The amounts disclosed for these items are: Established by government action; determined by standard calculations applied to ongoing fixed costs; or based on an obligation incurred by the consumer independently of any requirement imposed by the creditor. Except for prepaid interest under §&#160;1026.37(g)(2)(iii), or charges for optional credit insurance provided by the creditor, the creditor does not retain any of the amounts or portions of the amounts disclosed as other costs.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-Interp-2" id="37-g-Interp-2">2. <strong>Charges pursuant to property contract.</strong> The creditor is required to disclose charges that are described in §&#160;1026.37(g)(1) through (3). Other charges that are required to be paid at or before closing pursuant to the property contract for sale between the consumer and seller are disclosed on the Loan Estimate to the extent the creditor has knowledge of those charges when it issues the Loan Estimate, consistent with the good faith standard under §&#160;1026.19(e). A creditor has knowledge of those charges where, for example, it has the real estate purchase and sale contract. <em>See also</em> §&#160;1026.37(g)(4) and comment 37(g)(4)-3.</p>

<h3>37(g)(1) Taxes and other government fees.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-1-Interp-1" id="37-g-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Recording fees.</strong> Recording fees listed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(1) are fees assessed by a government authority to record and index the loan and title documents as required under State or local law. Recording fees are assessed based on the type of document to be recorded or its physical characteristics, such as the number of pages. Unlike transfer taxes, recording fees are not based on the sale price of the property or loan amount. For example, a fee for recording a subordination agreement that is $20, plus $3 for each page over three pages, is a recording fee, but a fee of $1,250 based on 0.5 percent of the loan amount is a transfer tax, and not a recording fee.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-1-Interp-2" id="37-g-1-Interp-2">2. <strong>Other government charges.</strong> Any charges or fees imposed by a State or local government that are not transfer taxes are aggregated with recording fees and disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-1-Interp-3" id="37-g-1-Interp-3">3. <strong>Transfer taxes - terminology.</strong> In general, transfer taxes listed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(1) are State and local government fees on mortgages and home sales that are based on the loan amount or sales price, while recording fees are State and local government fees for recording the loan and title documents. The name that is used under State or local law to refer to these amounts is not determinative of whether they are disclosed as transfer taxes or as recording fees and other taxes under §&#160;1026.37(g)(1).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-1-Interp-4" id="37-g-1-Interp-4">4. <strong>Transfer taxes - consumer.</strong> Only transfer taxes paid by the consumer are disclosed on the Loan Estimate pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g)(1). State and local government transfer taxes are governed by State or local law, which determines if the seller or consumer is ultimately responsible for paying the transfer taxes. For example, if State law indicates a lien can attach to the consumer's acquired property if the transfer tax is not paid, the transfer tax is disclosed. If State or local law is unclear or does not specifically attribute transfer taxes to the seller or the consumer, the creditor is in compliance with requirements of §&#160;1026.37(g)(1) if the amount of the transfer tax disclosed is not less than the amount apportioned to the consumer using common practice in the locality of the property.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-1-Interp-5" id="37-g-1-Interp-5">5. <strong>Transfer taxes - seller.</strong> Transfer taxes paid by the seller in a purchase transaction are not disclosed on the Loan Estimate under §&#160;1026.37(g)(1), but are disclosed on the Closing Disclosure pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(g)(1)(ii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-1-Interp-6" id="37-g-1-Interp-6">6. <strong>Deletion and addition of items.</strong> The lines and labels required by §&#160;1026.37(g)(1) may not be deleted, even if recording fees or transfer taxes are not charged to the consumer.

<h3>37(g)(3) Initial escrow payment at closing.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-3-Interp-1" id="37-g-3-Interp-1">1. <strong>Listed item not charged.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g)(3), each periodic charge to be included in the escrow or reserve account must be itemized under the “Initial Escrow Payment at Closing” subheading, with a relevant label, monthly payment amount, and number of months expected to be collected at consummation. If an item described in §&#160;1026.37(g)(3)(i) through (iii) is not charged to the consumer, the monthly payment amount and time period used in the labels are left blank.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-3-Interp-2" id="37-g-3-Interp-2">2. <strong>Aggregate escrow account calculation.</strong> The aggregate escrow account adjustment required under §&#160;1026.38(g)(3) and 12 CFR 1024.17(d)(2) is not included on the Loan Estimate under §&#160;1026.37(g)(3).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-3-Interp-3" id="37-g-3-Interp-3">3. <strong>Terminology.</strong> As used in §&#160;1026.37(g)(3), the term “property taxes” has the same meaning as in §&#160;1026.43(b)(8) and further described in comment 43(b)(8)-2; the term “homeowner's insurance” means the amounts identified in §&#160;1026.4(b)(8); and the term “mortgage insurance” has the same meaning as “mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent” in §&#160;1026.37(c).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-4-Interp-1" id="37-g-4-Interp-1">1. <strong>Owner's title insurance policy rate.</strong> The amount disclosed for an owner's title insurance premium pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g)(4) is based on a basic owner's policy rate, and not on an “enhanced” title insurance policy premium, except that the creditor may instead disclose the premium for an “enhanced” policy when the “enhanced” title insurance policy is required by the real estate sales contract, if such requirement is known to the creditor when issuing the Loan Estimate. This amount should be disclosed as “Title - Owner's Title Policy (optional),” or in any similar manner that includes the introductory description “Title -” at the beginning of the label for the item, the parenthetical description “(optional)” at the end of the label, and clearly indicates the amount of the premium disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g)(4) is for the owner's title insurance coverage. See comment 37(f)(2)-4 for a discussion of the disclosure of the premium for lender's title insurance coverage.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-4-Interp-2" id="37-g-4-Interp-2">2. <strong>Simultaneous title insurance premium rate in purchase transactions.</strong> The premium for an owner's title insurance policy for which a special rate may be available based on the simultaneous issuance of a lender's and an owner's policy is calculated and disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g)(4) as follows:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-g-4-Interp-2-i" id="37-g-4-Interp-2-i">i. The title insurance premium for a lender's title policy is based on the full premium rate, consistent with §&#160;1026.37(f)(2) or (f)(3).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-g-4-Interp-2-ii" id="37-g-4-Interp-2-ii">ii. The owner's title insurance premium is calculated by taking the full owner's title insurance premium, adding the simultaneous issuance premium for the lender's coverage, and then deducting the full premium for lender's coverage.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-4-Interp-3" id="37-g-4-Interp-3">3. <strong>Designation of optional items.</strong> Products disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(4) for which the parenthetical description “(optional)” is included at the end of the label for the item include only items that are separate from any item disclosed on the Loan Estimate under paragraphs other than §&#160;1026.37(g)(4). For example, such items may include optional owner's title insurance, credit life insurance, debt suspension coverage, debt cancellation coverage, warranties of home appliances and systems, and similar products, when coverage is written in connection with a credit transaction that is subject to §&#160;1026.19(e). However, because the requirement in §&#160;1026.37(g)(4)(ii) applies to separate products only, additional coverage and endorsements on insurance otherwise required by the lender are not disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(4). See comments 4(b)(7) and (b)(8)-1 through -3 and comments 4(b)(10)-1 and -2 for guidance on determining when credit life insurance, debt suspension coverage, debt cancellation coverage, and similar coverage is written in connection with a transaction subject to §&#160;1026.19(e).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-4-Interp-4" id="37-g-4-Interp-4">4. <strong>Examples.</strong> Examples of other items that are disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(4) if the creditor is aware of those items when it issues the Loan Estimate include commissions of real estate brokers or agents, additional payments to the seller to purchase personal property pursuant to the property contract, homeowner's association and condominium charges associated with the transfer of ownership, and fees for inspections not required by the creditor but paid by the consumer pursuant to the property contract. Although the consumer is obligated for these costs, they are not imposed upon the consumer by the creditor or loan originator. Therefore, they are not disclosed with the parenthetical description “(optional)” at the end of the label for the item, and they are disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g) rather than §&#160;1026.37(f). Even if such items are not required to be disclosed on the Loan Estimate under §&#160;1026.37(g)(4), however, they may be required to be disclosed on the Closing Disclosure pursuant to §&#160;1026.38. Comment 19(e)(3)(iii)-3 discusses application of the good faith requirement for services chosen by the consumer that are not required by the creditor.</p>

The creditor should ensure that the lender credit disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(6)(ii) is sufficient to cover the estimated costs the creditor represented to the consumer as not being required to be paid by the consumer at consummation, regardless of whether such representations pertained to specific items.</p>

For example, sale price is generally included in the closing costs financed calculation under §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(ii) as a component of the estimated total amount of payments to third parties. However, for simultaneous subordinate financing transactions, the estimated total amount of payments to third parties would not include the sale price. The estimated total amount of payments to third parties only includes payments occurring in the simultaneous subordinate financing transaction other than payments toward the sale price.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-h-1-ii-Interp-1" id="37-h-1-ii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Calculation of amount.</strong> The amount of closing costs financed disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(ii) is determined by subtracting the estimated total amount of payments to third parties not otherwise disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(f) and (g) from the loan amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(b)(1). The estimated total amount of payments to third parties includes the sale price disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(a)(7)(i), if applicable, unless otherwise excluded under comment 37(h)(1)-2. Other examples of payments to third parties not otherwise disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(f) and (g) include the amount of construction costs for transactions that involve improvements to be made on the property and payoffs of secured or unsecured debt. If the result of the calculation is zero or negative, the amount of $0 is disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(ii). If the result of the calculation is a positive number, that amount is disclosed as a negative number under §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(ii), but only to the extent that the absolute value of the amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(ii) does not exceed the total amount of closing costs disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(6).</p>

Section 1026.37(h)(1)(iii)(B) requires that, for all non-purchase transactions, the amount of estimated funds from the consumer is determined in accordance with §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(v). Pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(v), the amount to be disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(iii)(A)(<em>2</em>) or (B) is determined by subtracting the sum of the loan amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(b)(1) and any amount of existing loans assumed or taken subject to that will be disclosed under §&#160;1026.38(j)(2)(iv) (excluding any closing costs financed disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(ii)) from the total amount of all existing debt being satisfied in the transaction. The total amount of all existing debt being satisfied in the transaction is the sum of the amounts that will be disclosed on the Closing Disclosure in the summaries of transactions table under §&#160;1026.38(j)(1)(ii), (iii), and (v), as applicable. When the result of the calculation is positive, that amount is disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(iii) as “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower,” and $0 is disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(v) as “Funds for Borrower.” When the result of the calculation is negative, that amount is disclosed as a negative number under §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(v) as “Funds for Borrower,” and $0 is disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(iii) as “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower.” When the result is $0, $0 is disclosed as “Down Payment/Funds from Borrower” and “Funds for Borrower” under §&#160;1026.37(h)(1)(iii) and (v), respectively.</p>

<h3>37(i) Adjustable payment table.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-Interp-1" id="37-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>When table is not permitted to be disclosed.</strong> The disclosure described in §&#160;1026.37(i) is required only if the periodic principal and interest payment may change after consummation based on a loan term other than a change to the interest rate, or the transaction contains a seasonal payment product feature as described in §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(E). If the transaction does not contain such loan terms, this table shall not appear on the Loan Estimate.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-Interp-2" id="37-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>Periods to be disclosed.</strong> Section 1026.37(i)(1) through (4) requires disclosure of the periods during which interest only, optional payment, step payment, and seasonal payment product features will be in effect. The periods required to be disclosed should be disclosed by describing the number of payments counting from the first periodic payment due after consummation. The period of seasonal payments required to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.37(i)(4), to be clear and conspicuous, should be disclosed with a noun that identifies the unit-period, because such feature may apply on a regular basis during the loan term that does not depend on when regular periodic payments begin. The disclosures required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(1) through (4) may include abbreviations to fit in the space provided for the information on form H-24, provided the information is disclosed in a clear and conspicuous manner. For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-i-Interp-2-i" id="37-i-Interp-2-i">i. <strong>Period from date of consummation.</strong> If a loan has an interest only period for the first 60 regular periodic payments due after consummation, the disclosure states “for your first 60 payments.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-i-Interp-2-ii" id="37-i-Interp-2-ii">ii. <strong>Period during middle of loan term.</strong> If the loan has an interest only period between the 61st and 85th payments, the disclosure states “from your 61st to 85th payment.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-i-Interp-2-iii" id="37-i-Interp-2-iii">iii. <strong>Multiple successive periods.</strong> If there are multiple periods during which a certain adjustable payment term applies, such as a period of step payments that occurs from the first through 12th payments, does not occur from the 13th through 24th payments, and occurs again from the 25th through 36th payments, the period disclosed is the entire span of all such periods. Accordingly, such period is disclosed as “for your first 36 payments.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-i-Interp-2-iv" id="37-i-Interp-2-iv">iv. <strong>Seasonal payments.</strong> For a seasonal payment product with a unit-period of a month that does not require periodic payments for the months of June, July, and August each year during the loan term, because such feature depends on calendar months and not on when regular periodic payments begin, the period is disclosed as “from June to August.” For a transaction with a quarterly unit-period that does not require a periodic payment every third quarter during the loan term and does not depend on calendar months, the period is disclosed as “every third payment.” In the same transaction, if the seasonal payment feature ends after the 20th quarter, the period is disclosed as “every quarter until the 20th quarter.” As described above in this comment 37(i)-2, the creditor may abbreviate “quarter” to “quart.” or “Q.”</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-i-5-Interp" id="37-i-5-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(i)(5) Principal and interest payments.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-5-Interp-1" id="37-i-5-Interp-1">1. <strong>Statement of periodic payment frequency.</strong> The subheading required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) must include the unit-period of the transaction, such as “quarterly,” “bi-weekly,” or “annual.” This unit-period should be the same as disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(b)(3). <em>See</em> §&#160;1026.37(o)(5)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-5-Interp-2" id="37-i-5-Interp-2">2. <strong>Initial payment adjustment unknown.</strong> The disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) must state the number of the first payment for which the regular periodic principal and interest payment may change. This payment is typically set forth in the legal obligation. However, if the exact payment number of the first adjustment is not known at the time the creditor provides the Loan Estimate, the creditor must disclose the earliest possible payment that may change under the terms of the legal obligation, based on the information available to the creditor at the time, as the initial payment number and amount.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-5-Interp-3" id="37-i-5-Interp-3">3. <strong>Subsequent changes.</strong> The disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) must state the frequency of adjustments to the regular periodic principal and interest payment after the initial adjustment, if any, expressed in years, except if adjustments are more frequent than once every year, in which case the disclosure should be expressed as payments. If there is only one adjustment of the periodic payment under the terms of the legal obligation (for example, if the loan has an interest only period for the first 60 payments and there are no adjustments to the payment after the end of the interest only period), the disclosure should state: “No subsequent changes.” If the loan has graduated increases in the regular periodic payment every 12th payment, the disclosure should state: “Every year.” If the frequency of adjustments to the periodic payment may change under the terms of the legal obligation, the disclosure should state the smallest period of adjustments that may occur. For example, if an increase in the periodic payment is scheduled every sixth payment for 36 payments, and then every 12th payment for the next 24 payments, the disclosure should state: “Every 6th payment.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-5-Interp-4" id="37-i-5-Interp-4">4. <strong>Maximum payment.</strong> The disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) must state the larger of the maximum scheduled or maximum potential amount of a regular periodic principal and interest payment under the terms of the legal obligation, as well as the payment number of the first periodic principal and interest payment that can reach such amount. If the disclosed payment is scheduled, §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) requires that the disclosure state the payment number when such payment is reached with the preceding text, “starting at.” If the disclosed payment is only potential, as may be the case for a loan that permits optional payments, the disclosure states the earliest payment number when such payment can be reached with the preceding text, “as early as.” Section 1026.37(i)(5) requires that the first possible periodic principal and interest payment that can reach the maximum be disclosed. For example, for a fixed interest rate optional-payment loan with scheduled payments that result in negative amortization under the terms of the legal obligation, the maximum periodic payment disclosed should be based on the consumer having elected to make the periodic payments that would increase the principal balance to the maximum amount at the latest time possible before the loan begins to fully amortize, which would cause the periodic principal and interest payment to be the maximum possible. For example, if the earliest payment that could reach the maximum principal balance was the 41st payment at which time the loan would begin to amortize and the periodic principal and interest payment would be recalculated, but the last payment that permitted the principal balance to increase was the 60th payment, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) must assume the consumer only reaches the maximum principal balance at the 60th payment because this would result in the maximum possible principal and interest payment under the terms of the legal obligation. The disclosure must state the maximum periodic principal and interest payment based on this assumption and state “as early as the 61st payment.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-5-Interp-5" id="37-i-5-Interp-5">5. <strong>Payments that do not pay principal.</strong> Although the label of the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) is “Principal and Interest Payments,” and the section refers to periodic principal and interest payments, it includes a scheduled periodic payment that only covers some or all of the interest that is due and not any principal (<em>i.e.,</em> an interest only or negatively amortizing payment).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-j-Interp-1" id="37-j-Interp-1">1. <strong>When table is not permitted to be disclosed.</strong> The disclosure described in §&#160;1026.37(j) is required only if the interest rate may increase after consummation, either based on changes to an index or scheduled changes to the interest rate. If the legal obligation does not permit the interest rate to adjust after consummation, such as for a “Fixed Rate” product under §&#160;1026.37(a)(10), this table is not permitted to appear on the Loan Estimate. The creditor may not disclose a blank table or a table with “N/A” inserted within each row.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-j-1-Interp-1" id="37-j-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Index and margin.</strong> The index disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(j)(1) must be stated such that a consumer reasonably can identify it. A common abbreviation or acronym of the name of the index may be disclosed in place of the proper name of the index, if it is a commonly used public method of identifying the index. For example, “SOFR” may be disclosed instead of Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The margin should be disclosed as a percentage. For example, if the contract determines the interest rate by adding 4.25 percentage points to the index, the margin should be disclosed as “4.25%.”</p>

<h3>37(j)(2) Increases in interest rate.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-j-2-Interp-1" id="37-j-2-Interp-1">1. <strong>Adjustments not based on an index.</strong> If the legal obligation includes both adjustments to the interest rate based on an external index and scheduled and pre-determined adjustments to the interest rate, such as for a “Step Rate” product under §&#160;1026.37(a)(10), the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(j)(1), and not §&#160;1026.37(j)(2), must be provided pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(j)(2). The disclosure described in §&#160;1026.37(j)(2) is stated only if the product type does not permit the interest rate to adjust based on an external index.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-j-3-Interp-1" id="37-j-3-Interp-1">1. <strong>Interest rate at consummation.</strong> In all cases, the interest rate in effect at consummation must be disclosed as the initial interest rate, even if it will apply only for a short period, such as one month.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-j-4-Interp" id="37-j-4-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(j)(4) Minimum and maximum interest rate.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-j-4-Interp-1" id="37-j-4-Interp-1">1. <strong>Minimum interest rate.</strong> The minimum interest rate required to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.37(j)(4) is the minimum interest rate that may occur at any time during the term of the transaction, after any introductory or “teaser” interest rate expires, under the terms of the legal obligation, such as an interest rate “floor.” If the terms of the legal obligation do not state a minimum interest rate, the minimum interest rate that applies to the transaction under applicable law must be disclosed. If the terms of the legal obligation do not state a minimum interest rate, and no other minimum interest rate applies to the transaction under applicable law, the amount of the margin is disclosed.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-j-4-Interp-2" id="37-j-4-Interp-2">2. <strong>Maximum interest rate.</strong> The maximum interest rate required to be disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(j)(4) is the maximum interest rate permitted under the terms of the legal obligation, such as an interest rate “cap.” If the terms of the legal obligation do not specify a maximum interest rate, the maximum interest rate permitted by applicable law, such as State usury law, must be disclosed.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-j-5-Interp" id="37-j-5-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(j)(5) Frequency of adjustments.</h3>

This month is typically scheduled in the terms of the legal obligation. However, if the exact month is not known at the time the creditor provides the Loan Estimate, the creditor must disclose the earliest possible month under the terms of the legal obligation, based on the best information available to the creditor at the time.</p>

For example, if the initial interest rate adjustment is capped at two percent, the second adjustment is capped at two and a half percent, and all subsequent adjustments are capped at three percent, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(j)(6)(ii) states “3%.”</p>

<h3>37(k) Contact information.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-k-Interp-1" id="37-k-Interp-1">1. <strong>NMLSR ID.</strong> Section 1026.37(k) requires the disclosure of an Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (NMLSR ID) number for each creditor, mortgage broker, and loan officer identified on the Loan Estimate. The NMLSR ID is a unique number or other identifier generally assigned to individuals registered or licensed through NMLSR to provide loan originating services. For more information, see the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act) sections 1503(3) and (12) and 1504 (12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12) and 5103), and its implementing regulations (<em>i.e.,</em> 12 CFR 1007.103(a) and 1008.103(a)(2)). An entity may also have an NMLSR ID. Thus, if the creditor, mortgage broker, or loan officer has obtained an NMLSR ID, the NMLSR IDs must be provided in the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.37(k)(1) and (2).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-k-Interp-2" id="37-k-Interp-2">2. <strong>License number or unique identifier.</strong> Section 1026.37(k)(1) and (2) requires the disclosure of a license number or unique identifier for the creditor, mortgage broker, and loan officer if such entity or individual has not obtained an NMLSR ID. In such event, if the applicable State, locality, or other regulatory body with responsibility for licensing and/or registering such entity's or individual's business activities has issued a license number or other unique identifier to such entity or individual, that number is disclosed. In addition, §&#160;1026.37(k)(1) and (2) require the abbreviation of the State of the jurisdiction or regulatory body that issued such license or registration is required to be included before the word “License” in the label required by §&#160;1026.37(k)(1) and (2). If no such license or registration is required to be disclosed, such as if an NMLSR number is disclosed, the space provided for such an abbreviation in form H-24 of appendix H to this part may be left blank. A U.S. Postal Service State abbreviation complies with §&#160;1026.37(k)(1) and (2), if applicable.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-k-Interp-3" id="37-k-Interp-3">3. <strong>Contact.</strong> Section 1026.37(k)(2) requires the disclosure of the name and NMLSR ID of the person who is the primary contact for the consumer, labeled “Loan Officer.” The loan officer is generally the natural person employed by the creditor or mortgage broker disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(k)(1) who interacts most frequently with the consumer and who has an NMLSR ID or, if none, a license number or other unique identifier to be disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(k)(2), as applicable.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-k-Interp-4" id="37-k-Interp-4">4. <strong>Email address and phone number.</strong> Section 1026.37(k)(3) requires disclosure of the loan officer's email address and phone number. Disclosure of a general number or email address for the loan officer's lender or mortgage broker, as applicable, satisfies this requirement if no such information is generally available for such person.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 37(l)(1)(i).</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-l-1-i-Interp-1" id="37-l-1-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>Calculation of total payments in five years.</strong> The amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(l)(1)(i) is the sum of principal, interest, mortgage insurance, and loan costs scheduled to be paid through the end of the 60th month after the due date of the first periodic payment. For guidance on how to calculate interest for mortgage loans that are Adjustable Rate products under §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(i)(A) for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(l)(1)(i), see comment 17(c)(1)-10. In addition, for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(l)(1)(i), the creditor should assume that the consumer makes payments as scheduled and on time. For purposes of §&#160;1026.37(l)(1)(i), mortgage insurance means “mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent” as defined under comment 37(c)(1)(i)(C)-1 and includes prepaid or escrowed mortgage insurance. Loan costs are those costs disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(f).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-l-1-i-Interp-2" id="37-l-1-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>Negative amortization loans.</strong> For loans that have a negative amortization feature under §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(A), the creditor calculates the total payments in five years using the scheduled payments, even if it is a negatively amortizing payment amount, until the consumer must begin making fully amortizing payments under the terms of the legal obligation.</p>

<h3>37(l)(3) Total interest percentage.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-l-3-Interp-1" id="37-l-3-Interp-1">1. <strong>General.</strong> When calculating the total interest percentage, the creditor assumes that the consumer will make each payment in full and on time and will not make any additional payments. The creditor includes prepaid interest that the consumer will pay when calculating the total interest percentage. Prepaid interest that is disclosed as a negative number under §§&#160;1026.37(g)(2) or 1026.38(g)(2) is included as a negative value when calculating the total interest percentage.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-l-3-Interp-2" id="37-l-3-Interp-2">2. <strong>Adjustable rate and step rate mortgages.</strong> For Adjustable Rate products under §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(i)(A), §&#160;1026.37(l)(3) requires that the creditor compute the total interest percentage in accordance with comment 17(c)(1)-10. For Step Rate products under §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(i)(B), §&#160;1026.37(l)(3) requires that the creditor compute the total interest percentage in accordance with §&#160;1026.17(c)(1) and its associated commentary.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-l-3-Interp-3" id="37-l-3-Interp-3">3. <strong>Negative amortization loans.</strong> For loans that have a negative amortization feature under §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(A), §&#160;1026.37(l)(3) requires that the creditor compute the total interest percentage using the scheduled payment, even if it is a negatively amortizing payment amount, until the consumer must begin making fully amortizing payments under the terms of the legal obligation.</p>

<h3>37(m) Other considerations.</h3>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-m-1-Interp" id="37-m-1-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(m)(1) Appraisal.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-m-1-Interp-1" id="37-m-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Applicability.</strong> The disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(m)(1) is only applicable to transactions subject to §&#160;1026.19(e) that are also subject either to 15 U.S.C. 1639h or 1691(e) or both, as implemented by this part or Regulation B, 12 CFR part 1002, respectively. Accordingly, if a transaction is not also subject to either or both of these provisions, as implemented by this part or Regulation B, respectively, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(m)(1) may be omitted from the Loan Estimate as described by comment 37-1 as illustrated by form H-24 of appendix H to this part. For transactions subject to section 1639h but not section 1691(e), the creditor may delete the word “promptly” from the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(m)(1)(ii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-m-1-Interp-2" id="37-m-1-Interp-2">2. <strong>Consummation.</strong> Section 1026.37(m)(1) requires the creditor to disclose that it will provide a copy of any appraisal, even if the transaction is not consummated. On form H-24, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(m)(1) states that the creditor will provide an appraisal, even if the “loan does not close.” Pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(o)(3), the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(m)(1) is that illustrated by form H-24.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-m-2-Interp" id="37-m-2-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(m)(2) Assumption.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-m-2-Interp-1" id="37-m-2-Interp-1">1. <strong>Disclosure.</strong> Section 1026.37(m)(2) requires the creditor to disclose whether or not a third party may be allowed to assume the loan on its original terms if the property is sold or transferred by the consumer. In many cases, the creditor cannot determine, at the time the disclosure is made, whether a loan may be assumable at a future date on its original terms. For example, the assumption clause commonly used in mortgages sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation conditions an assumption on a variety of factors, such as the creditworthiness of the subsequent borrower, the potential for impairment of the creditor's security, and the execution of an assumption agreement by the subsequent borrower. If the creditor can determine that such assumption is not permitted, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(m)(2) by disclosing that the loan is not assumable. In all other situations, including where assumption of a loan is permitted or is dependent on certain conditions or factors, or uncertainty exists as to the future assumability of a mortgage loan, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(m)(2) by disclosing that, under certain conditions, the creditor may allow a third party to assume the loan on its original terms.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-m-2-Interp-2" id="37-m-2-Interp-2">2. <strong>Original terms.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.37(m)(2), the imposition of an assumption fee is not a departure from the original terms of the obligation but a modification of the legal obligation, such as a change in the contract interest rate, represents a departure from the original terms.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-m-3-Interp" id="37-m-3-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(m)(3) Homeowner's insurance.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-m-3-Interp-1" id="37-m-3-Interp-1">1. <strong>Optional disclosure.</strong> Section 1026.37(m)(3) provides that creditors may, but are not required to, disclose a statement of whether homeowner's insurance is required on the property and whether the consumer may choose the insurance provider, labeled “Homeowner's Insurance.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-m-3-Interp-2" id="37-m-3-Interp-2">2. <strong>Relation to the finance charge.</strong> Section 1026.4(d)(2) describes the conditions under which a creditor may exclude premiums for homeowner's insurance from the finance charge. For transactions subject to §&#160;1026.19(e), a creditor satisfies §&#160;1026.4(d)(2)(i) by disclosing the statement described in §&#160;1026.37(m)(3).</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-m-4-Interp" id="37-m-4-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(m)(4) Late payment.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-m-4-Interp-1" id="37-m-4-Interp-1">1. <strong>Definition.</strong> Section 1026.37(m)(4) requires a disclosure if charges are added to an individual delinquent installment by a creditor that otherwise considers the transaction ongoing on its original terms. Late payment charges do not include: (i) The right of acceleration; (ii) fees imposed for actual collection costs, such as repossession charges or attorney's fees; (iii) referral and extension charges; or (iv) the continued accrual of simple interest at the contract rate after the payment due date. However, an increase in the interest rate on account of a late payment by the consumer is a late payment charge to the extent of the increase.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-m-4-Interp-2" id="37-m-4-Interp-2">2. <strong>Applicability of State law.</strong> Many State laws authorize the calculation of late charges as either a percentage of the delinquent payment amount or a specified dollar amount, and permit the imposition of the lesser or greater of the two calculations. The language provided in the disclosure may reflect the requirements and alternatives allowed under State law.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-m-6-Interp" id="37-m-6-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(m)(6) Servicing.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-m-6-Interp-1" id="37-m-6-Interp-1">1. <strong>Creditor's intent.</strong> Section 1026.37(m)(6) requires the creditor to disclose whether it intends to service the loan directly or transfer servicing to another servicer after consummation. A creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(m)(6) if the disclosure reflects the creditor's intent at the time the Loan Estimate is issued.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-m-7-Interp" id="37-m-7-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(m)(7) Liability after foreclosure.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-m-7-Interp-1" id="37-m-7-Interp-1">1. <strong>When statement is not permitted to be disclosed.</strong> The disclosure described by §&#160;1026.37(m)(7) is required under the condition specified by §&#160;1026.37(m)(7), specifically, if the purpose of the credit transaction is a refinance under §&#160;1026.37(a)(9)(ii). Under any other conditions, this statement is not permitted to appear in the Loan Estimate.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-m-8-Interp" id="37-m-8-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(m)(8) Construction loans.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-m-8-Interp-1" id="37-m-8-Interp-1">1. <strong>Clear and conspicuous statement regarding redisclosure for construction loans.</strong> For construction loans in transactions involving new construction, where the creditor reasonably expects the settlement date to be 60 days or more after the provision of the disclosures required under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i), providing the statement, “You may receive a revised Loan Estimate at any time prior to 60 days before consummation” under the master heading “Additional Information About This Loan” and the heading “Other Considerations” pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(m)(8) satisfies the requirements set forth in §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(iv)(F) that the statement be made clearly and conspicuously on the disclosure.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="37-n-Interp" id="37-n-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(n) Signature statement.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-n-Interp-1" id="37-n-Interp-1">1. <strong>Signature line optional.</strong> Whether a signature line is provided under §&#160;1026.37(n) is determined solely by the creditor. If a signature line is provided, however, the disclosure must include the statement required by §&#160;1026.37(n)(1).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-n-Interp-2" id="37-n-Interp-2">2. <strong>Multiple consumers.</strong> If there is more than one consumer who will be obligated in the transaction, the first consumer signs as the applicant and each additional consumer signs as a co-applicant. If there is not enough space under the heading “Confirm Receipt” to provide signature lines for every consumer in the transaction, the creditor may add additional signature pages, as needed, at the end of the form for the remaining consumers' signatures. However, the creditor is required to disclose the heading and statement required by §&#160;1026.37(n)(1) on such additional pages.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-n-Interp-3" id="37-n-Interp-3">3. <strong>Consumer's name.</strong> The creditor may insert the consumer's name under the signature line, rather than using the designation “Applicant” or “Co-Applicant” as illustrated in form H-24 of appendix H to this part, but is not required to do so pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(n)(1).</p>

<h3>37(o) Form of disclosures.</h3>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-o-1-Interp" id="37-o-1-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(o)(1) General requirements.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-1-Interp-1" id="37-o-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Clear and conspicuous; segregation.</strong> The clear and conspicuous standard requires that the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.37 be legible and in a readily understandable form. Section 1026.37(o)(1)(i) requires that the disclosures be grouped together and segregated from everything else. For example, creditors may not add additional pages in between the pages of the Loan Estimate, or attach to the Loan Estimate additional pages that are not provided for under §&#160;1026.37 after the last page of the Loan Estimate. As required by §&#160;1026.37(o)(3)(i), the disclosures for any transaction that is a federally related mortgage loan under Regulation X, 12 CFR 1024.2, must be made using the standard form H-24 of appendix H to this part. Accordingly, use of that form constitutes compliance with the clear and conspicuous and segregation requirements of §&#160;1026.37(o). In addition, §&#160;1026.37(o)(1)(ii) requires creditors to disclose on the Loan Estimate only the information required by §&#160;1026.37(a) through (n), except as otherwise provided by §&#160;1026.37(o), and in the same order, and positioned relative to the master headings, headings, subheadings, labels, and similar designations in the same manner, as shown in form H-24, set forth in appendix H to this part. For example, creditors may not use form H-24, but include in the Loan Terms table under the subheading “Can this amount increase after closing?” information that is not required by §&#160;1026.37(b)(6).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-1-Interp-2" id="37-o-1-Interp-2">2. <strong>Balloon payment financing with leasing characteristics.</strong> In certain credit sale or loan transactions, a consumer may reduce the dollar amount of the payments to be made during the transaction by agreeing to make, at the end of the loan term, a large final payment based on the expected residual value of the property. The consumer may have a number of options with respect to the final payment, including, among other things, retaining the property and making the final payment, refinancing the final payment, or transferring the property to the creditor in lieu of the final payment. Such transactions may have some of the characteristics of lease transactions subject to Regulation M (12 CFR part 1013), but are considered credit transactions where the consumer assumes the indicia of ownership, including the risks, burdens, and benefits of ownership, upon consummation. These transactions are governed by the disclosure requirements of this part instead of Regulation M. Under §&#160;1026.37(o)(1)(ii), creditors may not include any additional information with the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.37, except as provided in §&#160;1026.37(o)(5). Thus, the disclosures must show the large final payment as a balloon payment in the projected payments table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) and should not, for example, reflect the other options available to the consumer at maturity.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-o-2-Interp" id="37-o-2-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(o)(2) Headings and labels.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-2-Interp-1" id="37-o-2-Interp-1">1. <strong>Estimated amounts.</strong> Section 1026.37(o)(2) incorporates the “estimated” designations reflected on form H-24 of appendix H to this part into the disclosure requirements of §&#160;1026.37, even if the relevant provision of §&#160;1026.37 does not expressly require or permit disclosure of the word “estimate.” Where form H-24 uses the abbreviation “est.” in place of the word “estimated,” §&#160;1026.37(o)(2) also incorporates that designation into its requirement. For example, §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(iv) requires disclosure of the total periodic payment labeled “Total Monthly Payment,” but the label on form H-24 contains the designation “Estimated” and thus, the label required by §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(iv) must contain the designation “Estimated.” Although many of the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.38 cross-reference their counterparts in §&#160;1026.37, §&#160;1026.38(t) incorporates the “estimated” designations reflected on form H-25, not form H-24.</p>
<div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-o-3-Interp" id="37-o-3-Interp"></div>
<h3>37(o)(3) Form.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-3-Interp-1" id="37-o-3-Interp-1">1. <strong>Non-federally related mortgage loans.</strong> For a non-federally related mortgage loan, the creditor is not required to use form H-24 of appendix H to this part, although its use as a model form for such transactions, if properly completed with accurate content, constitutes compliance with the clear and conspicuous and segregation requirements of §&#160;1026.37(o)(1)(i). Even when the creditor elects not to use the model form, §&#160;1026.37(o)(1) requires that the disclosures be grouped together and segregated from everything else; contain only the information required by §&#160;1026.37(a) through (n); and be provided in the same order as they occur in form H-24, using the same relative positions of the headings, labels, and similar designations as shown in the form. In addition, §&#160;1026.37(o)(2) requires that the creditor include the designation of “estimated” for all headings, subheading, labels, and similar designations required by §&#160;1026.37 for which form H-24 contains the “estimated” designation in such heading, subheading, label, or similar designation. The disclosures required by §&#160;1026.37 comply with the requirement to be in a format substantially similar to form H-24 when provided on letter size (8.5″ x 11″) paper.</p>

<h3>37(o)(4) Rounding.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-4-Interp-1" id="37-o-4-Interp-1">1. <strong>Rounding.</strong> Consistent with §&#160;1026.2(b)(4), except as otherwise provided in §&#160;1026.37(o)(4), any amount required to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.37 is not permitted to be rounded and is disclosed using decimal places where applicable, unless otherwise provided.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-4-Interp-2" id="37-o-4-Interp-2">2. <strong>Calculations.</strong> If a dollar amount that is required to be rounded by §&#160;1026.37(o)(4)(i) on the Loan Estimate is a total of one or more dollar amounts that are not required or permitted to be rounded, the total amount must be rounded consistent with §&#160;1026.37(o)(4)(i), but such component amounts used in the calculation must use such unrounded numbers. In addition, if any such unrounded component amount is required to be disclosed under §&#160;1026.37, consistent with §&#160;1026.2(b)(4), it should be disclosed as an unrounded number. If an amount that is required to be rounded by §&#160;1026.37(o)(4)(i) on the Loan Estimate is a total of one or more components that are also required to be rounded by §&#160;1026.37(o)(4)(i), the total amount must be calculated using such rounded amounts. For example, the subtotals required to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.37(f)(1), (2), and (3) are calculated using the rounded amounts disclosed under those subsections. <em>See also</em> comment 37(o)(4)(i)(C)-1. However, the amounts required to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.37(l) reference actual amounts for their components, rather than other amounts disclosed under §&#160;1026.37 and rounded pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(o)(4)(i), and thus, they are calculated using unrounded numbers.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-4-i-A-Interp-1" id="37-o-4-i-A-Interp-1">1. <strong>Rounding of dollar amounts.</strong> Section 1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A) requires that certain dollar amounts be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. For example, under §&#160;1026.37(o)(4)(i)(A), periodic mortgage insurance payments are rounded and disclosed to the nearest dollar, such that a periodic mortgage insurance payment of $164.50 is disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(ii) as $165, but a periodic mortgage insurance payment of $164.49 is disclosed as $164. The per-diem amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(2)(iii) and the monthly amounts for the initial escrow payment at closing disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g)(3)(i) through (iii) and (v) do not include partial cents. Dollar amounts are rounded or truncated to the nearest whole cent. For example, under §&#160;1026.37(g)(2)(iii), the creditor discloses per-diem interest of $68.1254 as $68.13 or $68.12. See form H-24(B) in appendix H to this part for an illustration of per-diem amounts for homeowner's insurance disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g)(3)(i).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-4-i-B-Interp-1" id="37-o-4-i-B-Interp-1">1. <strong>Rounding of loan amount.</strong> Section 1026.37(o)(4)(i)(B) requires the loan amount to be disclosed truncated at the decimal place if the loan amount is a whole number. For example, if §&#160;1026.37(b)(1) requires disclosure of a loan amount of $481,516.23, the creditor discloses the amount as $481,516.23. However, if the loan amount required to be disclosed were $481,516.00, the creditor would disclose $481,516.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-4-i-C-Interp-1" id="37-o-4-i-C-Interp-1">1. <strong>Rounding of the total monthly payment.</strong> Section 1026.37(o)(4)(i)(C) requires the total monthly payment amount disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(iv) to be rounded if any of its components are rounded. For example, if the total monthly payment disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(iv) is composed of a $2,000.49 periodic principal and interest payment required to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i) and a $164.49 periodic mortgage insurance payment required to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(ii), the creditor would calculate the total monthly payment by adding the exact periodic principal and interest payment of $2,000.49 and the rounded periodic mortgage insurance payment of $164, round the total, and disclose $2,164.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-4-ii-Interp-1" id="37-o-4-ii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Decimal places.</strong> Section 1026.37(o)(4)(ii) requires the percentage amounts disclosed rounding exact amounts to three decimal places, but the creditor does not disclose trailing zeros to the right of the decimal point. For example, a 2.4999 percent annual percentage rate is disclosed as “2.5%” under §&#160;1026.37(o)(4)(ii). Similarly, a 7.005 percent annual percentage rate is disclosed as “7.005%,” and a 7.000 percent annual percentage rate is disclosed as “7%.”</p>

<h3>37(o)(5) Exceptions.</h3>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-5-Interp-1" id="37-o-5-Interp-1">1. <strong>Permissible changes.</strong> The changes required or permitted by §&#160;1026.37(o)(5) are permitted for federally related mortgage loans for which the use of form H-24 is required under §&#160;1026.37(o)(3). For non-federally related mortgage loans, the changes required or permitted by §&#160;1026.37(o)(5) do not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure and therefore, are permissible. Any changes to the disclosure not specified in §&#160;1026.37(o)(5) or not permitted by other provisions of §&#160;1026.37 are not permissible for federally related mortgage loans. Creditors in non-federally related mortgage loans making any changes that affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure will lose their protection from civil liability under TILA section 130.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-5-Interp-2" id="37-o-5-Interp-2">2. <strong>Manual completion.</strong> Section 1026.37(o) does not require the creditor to use a computer, typewriter, or other word processor to complete the disclosure form. The information and amounts required to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.37 on form H-24 of appendix H to this part may be filled in by hand printing or using any other method, provided the information is clear and legible and complies with the formatting required by form H-24, including replicating bold font where required.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-5-Interp-3" id="37-o-5-Interp-3">3. <strong>Contact information.</strong> If a transaction involves more than one creditor or mortgage broker, the space provided on form H-24 of appendix H to this part for the contact information required by §&#160;1026.37(m) may be altered to add additional labels to accommodate the additional information of such parties, provided that the information required by §&#160;1026.37(l), (m), and (n) are disclosed on the same page as illustrated by form H-24. If the space provided on form H-24 of appendix H to this part does not allow for the disclosure of such contact and other information on the same page, an additional page may be added to provide the required contact information with an appropriate reference to the additional page.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-5-Interp-4" id="37-o-5-Interp-4">4. <strong>Unit-period.</strong> Section 1026.37(o)(5)(i) provides that wherever form H-24 or §&#160;1026.37 uses “monthly” to describe the frequency of any payments or uses “month” to describe the applicable unit-period, the creditor is required to substitute the appropriate term to reflect the fact that the transaction's terms provide for other than monthly periodic payments, such as bi-weekly or quarterly payments. For purposes of §&#160;1026.37, the term “unit-period” has the same meaning as in appendix J to Regulation Z.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-5-Interp-5" id="37-o-5-Interp-5">5. <strong>Additional page.</strong> Information required or permitted to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.37 on a separate page should be formatted similarly to form H-24 of appendix H to this part, so as not to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure. In addition, information provided on additional pages should be consolidated on as few pages as necessary to not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-5-Interp-6" id="37-o-5-Interp-6">6. <strong>Translation.</strong> Section 1026.37(o)(5)(ii) permits the translation of form H-24 into languages other than English, consistent with §&#160;1026.27. Pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(o)(5)(ii) creditors may modify form H-24 to the extent that translation prevents the headings, labels, designations, and required disclosure items under §&#160;1026.37 from fitting in the space provided on form H-24. For example, if the translation of a required label does not fit within the line provided for such label in form H-24, the label may be disclosed over two lines. See form H-28 of appendix H to this part for Spanish translations of form H-24.</p>

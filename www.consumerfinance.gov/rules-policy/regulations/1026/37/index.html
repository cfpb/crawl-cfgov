The creditor may use the estimate provided by the consumer at application unless it has performed its own estimate of the property value by the time the disclosure is provided to the consumer, in which case the creditor must use its own estimate. If the creditor has obtained any appraisals or valuations of the property for the application at the time the disclosure is issued to the consumer, the value determined by the appraisal or valuation to be used during underwriting for the application is disclosed as the estimated property value. If the creditor has obtained multiple appraisals or valuations and has not yet determined which one will be used during underwriting, it may disclose the value from any appraisal or valuation it reasonably believes it may use in underwriting the transaction. In a transaction that involves a seller, if the sale price is not yet known, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(a)(7) if it discloses the estimated value of the property that it used as the basis for the disclosures in the Loan Estimate.</p>

Where personal property is included in the sale price of the real property or cooperative unit (for example, if the consumer is purchasing the furniture inside the dwelling), however, §&#160;1026.37(a)(7) permits disclosure of the aggregate price without any reduction for the appraised or estimated value of the personal property.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-8-Interp-1-i" id="37-a-8-Interp-1-i">i. <strong>Terms to maturity of 24 months or more.</strong> Section 1026.37(a)(8) requires disclosure of the term to maturity in years, or months, or both, as applicable. Where the term exceeds 24 months and equals a whole number of years, a creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(a)(8) by disclosing the number of years, followed by the designation “years.” Where the term exceeds 24 months but does not equal a whole number of years, a creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(a)(8) by disclosing the term to maturity as the number of years followed by the designation “yr.” and the remaining number of months, followed by the designation “mo.” For example, if the term to maturity of the transaction is 185 months, the correct disclosure would be “15 yr. 5 mo.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-8-Interp-1-ii" id="37-a-8-Interp-1-ii">ii. <strong>Terms to maturity of less than 24 months.</strong> If the term to maturity is less than 24 months and does not equal a whole number of years, a creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(a)(8) by disclosing the number of months only, followed by the designation “mo.” For example, if the term to maturity of a transaction is six months or 16 months, it would be disclosed as “6 mo.” or “16 mo.,” respectively. If the term to maturity is 12 months, however it would be disclosed simply as “1 year.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-8-Interp-2" id="37-a-8-Interp-2">2. <strong>Adjustable loan term.</strong> Section 1026.37(a)(8) requires disclosure of the term to maturity of the credit transaction. If the term to maturity is adjustable, <em>i.e.,</em> it is not known with certainty at consummation, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(a)(8), if it discloses the possible range of the loan term, including the maximum number of years possible under the terms of the legal obligation. For example, if the loan term depends on the value of interest rate adjustments during the term of the loan, to calculate the maximum loan term, the creditor assumes that the interest rate rises as rapidly as possible after consummation, taking into account the terms of the legal obligation, including any applicable caps on interest rate adjustments and lifetime interest rate cap.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-9-Interp-1" id="37-a-9-Interp-1">1. <strong>General.</strong> Section 1026.37(a)(9) requires disclosure of the consumer's intended use of the credit. In ascertaining the consumer's intended use, §&#160;1026.37(a)(9) requires the creditor to consider all relevant information known to the creditor at the time of the disclosure. If the purpose is not known, the creditor may rely on the consumer's stated purpose. The following examples illustrate when each of the permissible purposes should be disclosed:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-9-Interp-1-i" id="37-a-9-Interp-1-i">i. <strong>Purchase.</strong> The consumer intends to use the proceeds from the transaction to purchase the property that will secure the extension of credit. In a purchase transaction with simultaneous subordinate financing, the simultaneous subordinate loan is also disclosed with the purpose “Purchase.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-9-Interp-1-ii" id="37-a-9-Interp-1-ii">ii. <strong>Refinance.</strong> The consumer refinances an existing obligation already secured by the consumer's dwelling to change the rate, term, or other loan features and may or may not receive cash from the transaction. For example, in a refinance with no cash provided, the new amount financed does not exceed the unpaid principal balance, any earned unpaid finance charge on the existing debt, and amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. Conversely, in a refinance with cash provided, the consumer refinances an existing mortgage obligation and receives money from the transaction that is in addition to the funds used to pay the unpaid principal balance, any earned unpaid finance charge on the existing debt, and amounts attributed solely to the costs of the refinancing. In such a transaction, the consumer may, for example, use the newly-extended credit to pay off the balance of the existing mortgage and other consumer debt, such as a credit card balance.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-9-Interp-1-iii" id="37-a-9-Interp-1-iii">iii. <strong>Construction.</strong> Section 1026.37(a)(9)(iii) requires the creditor to disclose that the loan is for construction in transactions where the creditor extends credit to finance only the cost of initial construction (construction-only loan), not renovations to existing dwellings, and in transactions where a multiple advance loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor (construction-permanent loan). In a construction-only loan, the borrower may be required to make interest-only payments during the loan term with the balance commonly due at the end of the construction project. For additional guidance on disclosing construction-permanent loans, see §&#160;1026.17(c)(6)(ii), comments 17(c)(6)-2, -3, and -5, and appendix D to this part.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-9-Interp-1-iv" id="37-a-9-Interp-1-iv">iv. <strong>Home equity loan.</strong> The creditor is required to disclose that the credit is for a “home equity loan” if the creditor intends to extend credit for any purpose other than a purchase, refinancing, or construction. This disclosure applies whether the loan is secured by a first or subordinate lien.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-9-Interp-2" id="37-a-9-Interp-2">2. <strong>Refinance coverage.</strong> The disclosure requirements under §&#160;1026.37(a)(9)(ii) apply to credit transactions that meet the definition of a refinancing under §&#160;1026.20(a) but without regard to whether they are made by a creditor, holder, or servicer of the existing obligation. Section 1026.20(a) applies only to refinancings undertaken by the original creditor or a holder or servicer of the original debt. <em>See</em> comment 20(a)-5.</p>

        <div class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="37-a-10-Interp" id="37-a-10-Interp"></div>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-1" id="37-a-10-Interp-1">1. <strong>No features.</strong> If the loan product disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) does not include any of the features described in §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii), only the product type and introductory and first adjustment periods, if applicable, are disclosed. For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-1-i" id="37-a-10-Interp-1-i">i. <strong>Adjustable rate.</strong> When disclosing an adjustable rate product, the disclosure of the loan product must be preceded by the length of the introductory period and the frequency of the first adjustment period thereafter. Thus, for example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory rate that is fixed for the first five years of the loan term and then adjusts every three years starting in year six, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) is “5/3 Adjustable Rate.” If the first adjustment period is not the period for all adjustments under the terms of the legal obligation, the creditor should still disclose the initial adjustment period and should not disclose other adjustment periods. For example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory rate that is fixed for the first five years of the loan term and then adjusts every three years starting in year six, and then annually starting in year fifteen, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) would still be “5/3 Adjustable Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-1-i-A" id="37-a-10-Interp-1-i-A">A. <strong>No introductory period.</strong> If the loan product is an adjustable rate with no introductory rate, the creditor should disclose “0” where the introductory rate period would ordinarily be disclosed. For example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate that adjusts every three years with no introductory period, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) is “0/3 Adjustable Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-1-i-B" id="37-a-10-Interp-1-i-B">B. <strong>Introductory period not yet known.</strong> If the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory period that is not yet known at the time of delivery of the Loan Estimate, the creditor should disclose the shortest potential introductory period for the particular loan product offered. For example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory period that may be between 36 and 48 months and the rate would then adjust every year, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) is “3/1 Adjustable Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-1-ii" id="37-a-10-Interp-1-ii">ii. <strong>Step rate.</strong> If the loan product is a step rate with an introductory interest rate that lasts for ten years and adjusts every year thereafter for the next five years, and then adjusts every three years for the next 15 years, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) is “10/1 Step Rate.” If the loan product is a step rate with no introductory rate, the creditor should disclose “0” where the introductory rate period would ordinarily be disclosed.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-1-iii" id="37-a-10-Interp-1-iii">iii. <strong>Fixed rate.</strong> If the loan product is not an adjustable rate or a step rate, as described in §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(i)(A) and (B), even if an additional feature described in §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii) may change the consumer's periodic payment, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(i) is “Fixed Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-2" id="37-a-10-Interp-2">2. <strong>Additional features.</strong> When disclosing a loan product with at least one of the features described in §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii), §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(iii) and (iv) require the disclosure of only the first applicable feature in the order of §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii) and that it be preceded by the time period or the length of the introductory period and the frequency of the first adjustment period, as applicable, followed by a description of the loan product and its time period as provided for in §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(i). For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-2-i" id="37-a-10-Interp-2-i">i. <strong>Negative amortization.</strong> Some loan products, such as “payment option” loans, permit the borrower to make payments that are insufficient to cover all of the interest accrued, and the unpaid interest is added to the principal balance. Where the loan product includes a loan feature that may cause the loan balance to increase, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(A) is preceded by the time period that the borrower is permitted to make payments that result in negative amortization (<em>e.g.,</em> “2 Year Negative Amortization”), followed by the loan product type. Thus, a fixed rate product with a step-payment feature for the first two years of the legal obligation that may negatively amortize is disclosed as “2 Year Negative Amortization, Fixed Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-2-ii" id="37-a-10-Interp-2-ii">ii. <strong>Interest only.</strong> When disclosing an “Interest Only” feature, as defined in §&#160;1026.18(s)(7)(iv), the applicable time period must precede the label “Interest Only.” Thus, a fixed rate loan with only interest due for the first five years of the loan term is disclosed as “5 Year Interest Only, Fixed Rate.” If the interest only feature fails to cover the total interest due, then, as required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(iii), the disclosure must reference the negative amortization feature and not the interest only feature (<em>e.g.,</em> “5 Year Negative Amortization, Fixed Rate”). See comment app. D-7.ii for an explanation of the disclosure of the time period of an interest only feature for a construction loan or a construction-permanent loan.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-2-iii" id="37-a-10-Interp-2-iii">iii. <strong>Step payment.</strong> When disclosing a step payment feature (which is sometimes referred to instead as a graduated payment), the period of time at the end of which the scheduled payments will change must precede the label “Step Payment” (<em>e.g.,</em> “5 Year Step Payment”) followed by the name of the loan product. Thus, a fixed rate mortgage subject to a 5-year step payment plan is disclosed as a “5 Year Step Payment, Fixed Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-2-iv" id="37-a-10-Interp-2-iv">iv. <strong>Balloon payment.</strong> If a loan product includes a “balloon payment,” as that term is defined in §&#160;1026.37(b)(5), the disclosure of the balloon payment feature, including the year the payment is due, precedes the disclosure of the loan product. Thus, if the loan product is a step rate with an introductory rate that lasts for three years and adjusts each year thereafter until the balloon payment is due in the seventh year of the loan term, the disclosure required is “Year 7 Balloon Payment, 3/1 Step Rate.” If the loan product includes more than one balloon payment, only the earliest year that a balloon payment is due shall be disclosed.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-2-v" id="37-a-10-Interp-2-v">v. <strong>Seasonal payment.</strong> If a loan product includes a seasonal payment feature, §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(E) requires that the creditor disclose the feature. The feature is not, however, required to be disclosed with any preceding time period. Disclosure of the label “Seasonal Payment” without any preceding number of years satisfies this requirement.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-3" id="37-a-10-Interp-3">3. <strong>Periods not in whole years.</strong></p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-3-i" id="37-a-10-Interp-3-i">i. <strong>Terms of 24 months or more.</strong> For product types and features that have introductory periods or adjustment periods that do not equate to a number of whole years, if the period is a number of months that is 24 or greater and does not equate to a whole number of years, §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) requires disclosure of the whole number of years followed by a decimal point with the remaining months rounded to two places. For example, if the loan product is an adjustable rate with an introductory period of 30 months that adjusts every year thereafter, the creditor would be required to disclose “2.5/1 Adjustable Rate.” If the introductory period were 31 months, the required disclosure would be 2.58/1 Adjustable Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-3-ii" id="37-a-10-Interp-3-ii">ii. <strong>Terms of less than 24 months.</strong> For product types and features that have introductory periods or adjustment periods that do not equate to a number of whole years, if the period is less than 24 months, §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) requires disclosure of the number of months, followed by the designation “mo.” For example, if the product type is an adjustable rate with an 18-month introductory period that adjusts every 18 months starting in the 19th month, the required disclosure would be “18 mo./18mo. Adjustable Rate.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-a-10-Interp-3-iii" id="37-a-10-Interp-3-iii">iii. <strong>Adjustments more frequent than monthly.</strong> For adjustment periods that change more frequently than monthly, §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) requires disclosure of the applicable unit-period, such as daily, weekly, or bi-weekly. For example, for an adjustable rate construction loan with no introductory fixed rate period where the interest rate adjusts every seven days, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(10) is “0/Weekly Adjustable Rate.”</p>

If the consumer fails to indicate an intent to proceed with the transaction within 10 business days after the disclosures were originally provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iii) (or within any longer time period established by the creditor), then, for determining good faith under §&#160;1026.19(e)(3)(i) and (ii), a creditor may use a revised estimate of a charge instead of the amount originally disclosed under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(i). <em>See</em> comment 19(e)(3)(iv)(E)-2.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-a-13-Interp-3" id="37-a-13-Interp-3">3. <strong>Time zone.</strong> The disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(a)(13) requires the applicable time zone for all times provided, as determined by the creditor. For example, if the creditor is located in New York and determines that the Loan Estimate will expire at 5:00 p.m. in the time zone applicable to its location, while standard time is in effect, the disclosure must include a reference to the Eastern time zone (<em>i.e.,</em> 5:00 p.m. EST).</p>

The creditor may extend the period of availability to expire beyond the time disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(a)(13)(ii). If the consumer indicates an intent to proceed within that longer time period, the date and time at which estimated closing costs expire are left blank on subsequent revised disclosures, if any. <em>See</em> comment 19(e)(3)(iv)-5.</p>

Although §&#160;1026.37(b)(2) refers to the index plus margin “at consummation,” if the index value that will be in effect at consummation is unknown at the time the disclosures are provided under §&#160;1026.19(e)(1)(iii), <em>i.e.,</em> within three business days after receipt of a consumer's application, the fully-indexed rate disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(b)(2) may be based on the index in effect at the time the disclosure is delivered. The index in effect at consummation (or the time the disclosure is delivered under §&#160;1026.19(e)) need not be used if the contract provides for a delay in the implementation of changes in an index value.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-1" id="37-b-4-Interp-1">1. <strong>Transaction includes a prepayment penalty.</strong> Section 1026.37(b)(4) requires disclosure of a statement of whether the transaction includes a prepayment penalty. If the transaction includes a prepayment penalty, §&#160;1026.37(b)(7) sets forth the information that must be disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(b)(4) (<em>i.e.,</em> the maximum amount of the prepayment penalty that may be imposed under the terms of the loan contract and the date on which the penalty will no longer be imposed). For an example of such disclosure, see form H-24 of appendix H to this part. The disclosure under §&#160;1026.37(b)(4) applies to transactions where the terms of the loan contract provide for a prepayment penalty, even though the creditor does not know at the time of the disclosure whether the consumer will, in fact, make a payment to the creditor that would cause imposition of the penalty. For example, if the monthly interest accrual amortization method described in comment 37(b)(4)-2.i is used such that interest is assessed on the balance for a full month even if the consumer makes a full prepayment before the end of the month, the transaction includes a prepayment penalty that must be disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(b)(4).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-2" id="37-b-4-Interp-2">2. <strong>Examples of prepayment penalties.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.37(b)(4), the following are examples of prepayment penalties:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-2-i" id="37-b-4-Interp-2-i">i. A charge determined by treating the loan balance as outstanding for a period of time after prepayment in full and applying the interest rate to such “balance,” even if the charge results from interest accrual amortization used for other payments in the transaction under the terms of the loan contract. “Interest accrual amortization” refers to the method by which the amount of interest due for each period (<strong>e.g.,</strong> month) in a transaction's term is determined. For example, “monthly interest accrual amortization” treats each payment as made on the scheduled, monthly due date even if it is actually paid early or late (until the expiration of any grace period). Thus, under the terms of a loan contract providing for monthly interest accrual amortization, if the amount of interest due on May 1 for the preceding month of April is $3,000, the loan contract will require payment of $3,000 in interest for the month of April whether the payment is made on April 20, on May 1, or on May 10. In this example, if the consumer prepays the loan in full on April 20 and if the accrued interest as of that date is $2,000, then assessment of a charge of $3,000 constitutes a prepayment penalty of $1,000 because the amount of interest actually earned through April 20 is only $2,000.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-2-ii" id="37-b-4-Interp-2-ii">ii. A fee, such as an origination or other loan closing cost, that is waived by the creditor on the condition that the consumer does not prepay the loan. See comment 37(b)(4)-3.iii below for additional guidance regarding waived bona fide third-party charges imposed by the creditor if the consumer pays all of a covered transaction's principal before the date on which the principal is due sooner than 36 months after consummation.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-2-iii" id="37-b-4-Interp-2-iii">iii. A minimum finance charge in a simple interest transaction.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-2-iv" id="37-b-4-Interp-2-iv">iv. Computing a refund of unearned interest by a method that is less favorable to the consumer than the actuarial method, as defined by section 933(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, 15 U.S.C. 1615(d). For purposes of computing a refund of unearned interest, if using the actuarial method defined by applicable State law results in a refund that is greater than the refund calculated by using the method described in section 933(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, creditors should use the State law definition in determining if a refund is a prepayment penalty.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-3" id="37-b-4-Interp-3">3. <strong>Fees that are not prepayment penalties.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.37(b)(4), fees that are not prepayment penalties include, for example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-3-i" id="37-b-4-Interp-3-i">i. Fees imposed for preparing and providing documents when a loan is paid in full, if such fees are imposed whether or not the loan is prepaid. Examples include a loan payoff statement, a reconveyance document, or another document releasing the creditor's security interest in the dwelling that secures the loan.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-3-ii" id="37-b-4-Interp-3-ii">ii. Loan guarantee fees.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-3-iii" id="37-b-4-Interp-3-iii">iii. A waived bona fide third-party charge imposed by the creditor if the consumer pays all of a covered transaction's principal before the date on which the principal is due sooner than 36 months after consummation. For example, assume that at consummation, the creditor waives $3,000 in closing costs to cover bona fide third-party charges but the terms of the loan agreement provide that the creditor may recoup the $3,000 in waived charges if the consumer repays the entire loan balance sooner than 36 months after consummation. The $3,000 charge is not a prepayment penalty. In contrast, for example, assume that at consummation, the creditor waives $3,000 in closing costs to cover bona fide third-party charges but the terms of the loan agreement provide that the creditor may recoup $4,500 in part to recoup waived charges, if the consumer repays the entire loan balance sooner than 36 months after consummation. The $3,000 that the creditor may impose to cover the waived bona fide third-party charges is not a prepayment penalty, but the additional $1,500 charge is a prepayment penalty and must be disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(b)(4).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-4-Interp-4" id="37-b-4-Interp-4">4. <strong>Rebate of finance charge.</strong> For an obligation that includes a finance charge that does not take into account each reduction in the principal balance of the obligation, the disclosure under §&#160;1026.37(b)(4) reflects whether or not the consumer is entitled to a rebate of any finance charge if the obligation is prepaid in full or part. Finance charges that do not take into account each reduction in the principal balance of an obligation may include precomputed finance charges. If any portion of an unearned precomputed finance charge will not be provided as a rebate upon full prepayment, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(b)(4) will be an affirmative answer, indicate the maximum amount of such precomputed finance charge that may not be provided as a rebate to the consumer upon any prepayment, and state when the period during which a full rebate would not be provided terminates, as required by §&#160;1026.37(b)(7). If, instead, there will be a full rebate of the precomputed finance charge and no other prepayment penalty imposed on the consumer, to comply with the requirements of §&#160;1026.37(b)(4) and (7), the creditor states a negative answer only. If the transaction involves both a precomputed finance charge and a finance charge computed by application of a rate to an unpaid balance, disclosure about both the entitlement to any rebate of the finance charge upon prepayment and any other prepayment penalty are made as one disclosure under §&#160;1026.37(b)(4), stating one affirmative or negative answer and an aggregated amount and time period for the information required by §&#160;1026.37(b)(7). For example, if in such a transaction, a portion of the precomputed finance charge will not be provided as a rebate and the loan contract also provides for a prepayment penalty based on the amount prepaid, both disclosures are made under §&#160;1026.37(b)(4) as one aggregate amount, stating the maximum amount and time period under §&#160;1026.37(b)(7). If the transaction instead provides a rebate of the precomputed finance charge upon prepayment, but imposes a prepayment penalty based on the amount prepaid, to comply with §&#160;1026.37(b)(4), the creditor states an affirmative answer and the information about the prepayment penalty, as required by §&#160;1026.37(b)(7). For further guidance and examples of these types of charges, see comment 18(k)(2)-1. For analogous guidance, see comment 18(k)-2.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-b-5-Interp-1" id="37-b-5-Interp-1">1. <strong>Regular periodic payment.</strong> If a payment is not itself a regular periodic payment and is more than two times any one regular periodic payment during the loan term, then it is disclosed as a balloon payment under §&#160;1026.37(b)(5). The regular periodic payments used to determine whether a payment is a balloon payment under §&#160;1026.37(b)(5) are the payments of principal and interest (or interest only, depending on the loan features) specified under the terms of the loan contract that are due from the consumer for two or more unit-periods in succession. All regular periodic payments during the loan term are used to determine whether a particular payment is a balloon payment, regardless of whether the regular periodic payments have changed during the loan term due to rate adjustments or other payment changes permitted or required under the loan contract.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-5-Interp-1-i" id="37-b-5-Interp-1-i">i. For example, assume that, under a 15-year step rate mortgage, the loan contract provides for scheduled monthly payments of $300 each during the years one through three and scheduled monthly payments of $700 each during years four through 15. If an irregular payment of $1,000 is scheduled during the final month of year 15, that payment is disclosed as a balloon payment under §&#160;1026.37(b)(5), because it is more than two times the regular periodic payment amount of $300 during years one through three. This is the case even though the irregular payment is not more than two times the regular periodic payment of $700 per month during years four through fifteen. The $700 monthly payments during years four through fifteen are not balloon payments even though they are more than two times the regular periodic payments during years one through three, because they are regular periodic payments.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-5-Interp-1-ii" id="37-b-5-Interp-1-ii">ii. If the loan has an adjustable rate under which the regular periodic payments may increase after consummation, but the amounts of such payment increases (if any) are unknown at the time of consummation, then the regular periodic payments are based on the fully-indexed rate, except as otherwise determined by any premium or discounted rates, the application of any interest rate adjustment caps, or any other known, scheduled rates under the terms specified in the loan contract. For analogous guidance, see comments 17(c)(1)-8 and -10. Similarly, if a loan has an adjustable interest rate which does not adjust the regular periodic payment but would, if the rate increased, increase only the final payment, the amount of the final payment for purposes of the balloon payment determination is based on the fully-indexed rate, except as otherwise determined by any premium or discounted rate caps, or any other known, scheduled rates under the terms specified in the loan contract. For example, assume that, under a 30-year adjustable rate mortgage, (1) the loan contract requires monthly payments of $300 during years one through five, (2) the loan contract permits interest rate increases every three years starting in the sixth year up to the fully-indexed rate, subject to caps on interest rate adjustments specified in the loan contract, (3) based on the application of the interest rate adjustment caps, the interest rate may increase to the fully-indexed rate starting in year nine, and (4) the monthly payment based on the fully-indexed rate is $700. The regular periodic payments during years one through five are $300 per month, because they are known and scheduled. The regular periodic payments during years six through eight are up to $700 per month, based on the fully-indexed rate but subject to the application of interest rate adjustment caps specified under the loan contract. The regular periodic payments during years nine through thirty are $700, based on the fully-indexed rate. Therefore, if an irregular payment of $1,000 is scheduled during the final month of year 30, that payment is disclosed as a balloon payment under §&#160;1026.37(b)(5), because it is more than two times the regular periodic payment amount of $300 during years one through five. This is the case even though the irregular payment is not more than two times the regular periodic payment during years nine through thirty (<strong>i.e.,</strong> based on the fully-indexed rate). However, the regular periodic payments during years six through thirty themselves are not balloon payments, even though they may be more than two times the regular periodic payments during years one through five.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-5-Interp-1-iii" id="37-b-5-Interp-1-iii">iii. For a loan with a negative amortization feature, the regular periodic payment does not take into account the possibility that the consumer may exercise an option to make a payment greater than the scheduled periodic payment specified under the terms of the loan contract, if any.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-b-5-Interp-1-iv" id="37-b-5-Interp-1-iv">iv. A final payment that differs from other regular periodic payments because of rounding to account for payment amounts including fractions of cents is still a regular periodic payment and need not be disclosed as a balloon payment under §&#160;1026.37(b)(5).</p>

The creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(b)(7)(i) when it assumes that the consumer prepays at a time when the prepayment penalty may be charged and that the consumer makes all payments prior to the prepayment on a timely basis and in the amount required by the terms of the legal obligation. The creditor must determine the maximum of each amount used in calculating the prepayment penalty. For example, if a transaction is fully amortizing and the prepayment penalty is two percent of the loan balance at the time of prepayment, the prepayment penalty amount should be determined by using the highest loan balance possible during the period in which the penalty may be imposed. If more than one type of prepayment penalty applies, the creditor must aggregate the maximum amount of each type of prepayment penalty in the maximum penalty disclosed.</p>

For examples of discounted and premium rate transactions, see comment 17(c)(1)-10.v. For guidance regarding whether the disclosure should reflect a buydown, see comments 17(c)(1)-3 through -5. If the initial periodic payment or range of payments may vary based on an adjustment to an index value that applies at consummation, §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i) requires that the disclosure of the initial periodic payment or range of payments be based on the fully-indexed rate disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(b)(2).

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-i-A-Interp-2" id="37-c-1-i-A-Interp-2">2. <strong>Negative amortization.</strong> In a loan that contains a negative amortization feature, periodic principal and interest payments or the range of such payments may change for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) at the time the negative amortization period ends under the terms of the legal obligation, meaning the consumer must begin making payments that do not result in an increase of the principal balance. The occurrence of an event requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges of payments should be based on the assumption that the consumer will make payments as scheduled or, if applicable, elect to make the periodic payments that would extend the negative amortization period to the latest time permitted under the terms of the legal obligation. The occurrence of all subsequent events requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges of payments should be based on this assumption. The table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) should also reflect any balloon payment that would result from such scheduled payments or election.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-i-C-Interp-1" id="37-c-1-i-C-Interp-1">1. <strong>General.</strong> “Mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent” means the amounts identified in §&#160;1026.4(b)(5). For purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c), “mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent” includes any mortgage guarantee that provides coverage similar to mortgage insurance (such as a United States Department of Veterans Affairs or United States Department of Agriculture guarantee), even if not technically considered insurance under State or other applicable law. The fees for such a guarantee are included in “mortgage insurance premiums.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-i-C-Interp-2" id="37-c-1-i-C-Interp-2">2. <strong>Calculation of mortgage insurance termination.</strong> For purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(C), mortgage insurance premiums should be calculated based on the declining principal balance that will occur as a result of changes to the interest rate and payment amounts, applying the interest rates applicable to the transaction. Such calculation should take into account any initial discounted or premium interest rate. For example, for an adjustable rate transaction that has a discounted interest rate during an initial five-year period, the creditor makes the calculation using a composite rate based on the rate in effect during the initial five-year period and, thereafter, the fully-indexed rate, unless otherwise required by applicable law. For guidance on calculation of the amount of mortgage insurance premiums to disclose on the table required by §&#160;1026.37(c), see §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(ii) and its commentary. See comment 37(b)(2)-1 for guidance regarding calculating the fully-indexed rate.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-i-C-Interp-3" id="37-c-1-i-C-Interp-3">3. <strong>Disclosure of mortgage insurance termination.</strong> The table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) should reflect the consumer's mortgage insurance premiums until the date on which the creditor must automatically terminate coverage under applicable law, even though the consumer may have a right to request that the insurance be cancelled earlier. Unlike termination of mortgage insurance, a subsequent decline in the consumer's mortgage insurance premiums is not, by itself, an event that requires the disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges of payments in the table required by §&#160;1026.37(c). For example, some mortgage insurance programs annually adjust premiums based on the declining loan balance. Such annual adjustment to the amount of premiums would not require a separate disclosure of a periodic payment or range payments.</p>

Although the balloon payment that is scheduled as the final payment under the terms of the legal obligation occurs after the third separate periodic payment or range of payments, the creditor discloses the final balloon payment as a separate event requiring disclosure of additional periodic payments or range of payments due to the special rule in §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(ii)(A).</p>

This means that the automatic termination of mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent under applicable law is disclosed as its own event only if there is a column in which to disclose it, <em>i.e.,</em> there are only three other separate periodic payments or ranges of payments that are required to be disclosed. Where the automatic termination of mortgage insurance or any functional equivalent under applicable law is not disclosed as a separate periodic payment or range of payments, the absence of a required mortgage insurance payment is disclosed with the next disclosed event requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges of payments, as applicable.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-ii-B-Interp-2" id="37-c-1-ii-B-Interp-2">2. <strong>Examples of special rule regarding disclosure of the automatic termination of mortgage insurance.</strong> i. Assume a step-rate loan with a 30-year term with an introductory interest rate that lasts for five years, a different interest rate that applies for the next five-year period, a final interest rate adjustment after 10 years, where mortgage insurance would terminate for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(C) in the third year, and where no escrow account would be established for the payment of charges described in §&#160;1026.37(c)(4)(ii). The creditor would disclose on the table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) the initial periodic payment for years one through three (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the introductory interest rate and payments for mortgage insurance premiums), an additional separate periodic payment for years four and five (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the introductory rate and no payments for mortgage insurance premiums), an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments for years six through 10 (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the interest rate that would apply after the introductory rate), and an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments for years 11 through 30 (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the interest rate that would apply after the second interest rate adjustment until the end of the loan term). In this example, the automatic termination of mortgage insurance would be separately disclosed on the table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) because the total number of separate periodic payments or ranges of payments otherwise disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(c)(1) does not exceed three.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-1-ii-B-Interp-ii" id="37-c-1-ii-B-Interp-ii">ii. Assume the same loan as above, except that the terms of the legal obligation also provide for a third interest rate adjustment that would occur after 15 years. The creditor would disclose on the table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) the initial periodic payment for years one through five (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the introductory interest rate and payments for mortgage insurance premiums), an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments for years six through 10 (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the interest rate that would apply after the first interest rate adjustment and no payments for mortgage insurance premiums), an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments for years 11 through 15 (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the interest rate that would apply after the second interest rate adjustment), and an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments for years 16 through 30 (reflecting the principal and interest payment corresponding to the interest rate that would apply after the third interest rate adjustment until the end of the loan term). In this example, the automatic termination of mortgage insurance would not be separately disclosed on the table required by §&#160;1026.37(c) because the total number of separate periodic payments or ranges of payments otherwise disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(c)(1) exceeds three. However, the creditor would disclose the termination of mortgage insurance beginning with the periodic payment or range of payments for years six through 10, which is the next disclosed event requiring disclosure of additional separate periodic payments or ranges of payments.</p>

For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1-i" id="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1-i">i. Assume a loan with a 30-year term with a payment that adjusts every month for the first 12 months and is fixed thereafter, where mortgage insurance is not required, and where no escrow account would be established for the payment of charges described in §&#160;1026.37(c)(4)(ii).

Under §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D), the creditor also discloses, as an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments, the periodic principal and interest payment or range of payments that would apply after the payment becomes fixed.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1-ii" id="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1-ii">ii.

The creditor discloses as a single range of payments the initial periodic payment, the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at three months, and the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at six months, which single range represents the minimum payment and maximum payment, respectively, which would apply during the first year of the loan. Under §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D), the creditor also discloses as an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments, the principal and interest payment that would apply on the first anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment or range of payments, because that is the anniversary that immediately follows the occurrence of the multiple payments or ranges of payments that occurred during the first year of the loan.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1-iii" id="37-c-1-iii-B-Interp-1-iii">iii. Assume that the same loan has a payment that, instead of becoming fixed after the adjustment at six months, adjusts once more at 18 months and becomes fixed thereafter. The creditor discloses the same single range of payments for year one. Under §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(D), the creditor separately discloses the principal and interest payment that would apply on the first anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment in year two. Under §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) and (c)(3)(ii), beginning in the next year in the sequence (<strong>i.e.,</strong> in year three), the creditor separately discloses the periodic payment that would apply after the payment adjustment that occurs at 18 months.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-2-i-Interp-1" id="37-c-2-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>General rule for adjustable rate loans.</strong> For an adjustable rate loan, in disclosing the maximum possible payment for principal and interest under §&#160;1026.37(c), the creditor assumes that the interest rate will rise as rapidly as possible after consummation, taking into account the terms of the legal obligation, including any applicable caps on interest rate adjustments and lifetime interest rate cap. For a loan with no lifetime interest rate cap, the maximum rate is determined by reference to other applicable laws, such as State usury law. In disclosing the minimum payment for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c), the creditor assumes that the interest rate will decrease as rapidly as possible after consummation, taking into account any introductory rates, caps on interest rate adjustments, and lifetime interest rate floor. For an adjustable rate loan based on an index that has no lifetime interest rate floor, the minimum interest rate is equal to the margin.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-2-i-Interp-2" id="37-c-2-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>Special rule for adjustable rate loans with negative amortization features.</strong> Section 1026.37(c)(2)(i)(B) provides a special rule for calculation of the maximum principal and interest payment in an adjustable rate loan that contains a negative amortization feature. That section provides that the maximum amounts payable for principal and interest after the negative amortization period ends are calculated using the maximum principal amount permitted under the terms of the legal obligation at the end of the negative amortization period. See section §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(i)(A) and associated commentary for guidance regarding when the negative amortization period ends for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c)(2). For example, if the maximum principal balance for the last payment in the negative amortization period is achieved at an interest rate that is not the maximum interest rate permitted under the terms of the legal obligation before the negative amortization period ends, future events requiring disclosure of additional, separate periodic payments or ranges of payments assume that the interest rate in effect at the end of the negative amortization period was such interest rate, and not the maximum possible interest rate. After the end of the negative amortization period, the general rule under §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i)(A) regarding assumptions of interest rate changes for the maximum principal and interest payment to be disclosed applies from such interest rate. The minimum payment in an adjustable rate loan that contains a negative amortization feature is determined pursuant to the general rule under §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i)(A).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-2-i-Interp-3" id="37-c-2-i-Interp-3">3. <strong>Disclosure of balloon payment amounts.</strong> Although the existence of a balloon payment is determined pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(b)(5) and its commentary (<em>see</em> comment 37(c)(1)(i)(B)-1), balloon payment amounts to be disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(c) are calculated in the same manner as periodic principal and interest payments under §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i). For example, for a balloon payment amount that can change depending on previous interest rate adjustments that are based on the value of an index at the time of the adjustment, the balloon payment amounts are calculated using the assumptions for minimum and maximum interest rates described in §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i) and its commentary, and should be disclosed as a range of payments.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-3-ii-Interp-1" id="37-c-3-ii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Years.</strong> Section 1026.37(c)(3)(ii) requires that each separate periodic payment or range of payments be disclosed under a subheading that states the years during which that payment or range of payments will apply and that such subheadings be stated in a sequence of whole years from the due date of the initial periodic payment. Therefore, for purposes of §&#160;1026.37(c), “year” is defined as the twelve-month interval beginning on the due date of the initial periodic payment, and the next whole year begins each anniversary thereafter. If an event requiring the disclosure of an additional separate periodic payment or range of payments occurs on a date other than the anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment, and no other events occur during that single year requiring disclosure of multiple events under §&#160;1026.37(c)(1)(iii)(B), such event is disclosed beginning in the next year in the sequence, because the separate periodic payment or range of payments that applied during the previous year will also apply during a portion of that year. For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-c-3-ii-Interp-1-i" id="37-c-3-ii-Interp-1-i">i. Assume a fixed rate loan with a term of 124 months (10 years, four months). The creditor would label the disclosure of periodic payments as “Years 1-11.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-c-3-ii-Interp-1-ii" id="37-c-3-ii-Interp-1-ii">ii. Assume a loan with a 30-year term that does not require mortgage insurance and requires interest only payments for the first 60 months from the due date of the initial periodic payment, then requires fixed, fully amortizing payments of principal and interest beginning at the 61st month for the duration of the loan, the creditor would label the first disclosure of periodic payments as “Years 1-5” (including the term “only interest” pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i)) and the second disclosure of periodic payments or range of payments as “Years 6-30.” If that loan requires interest only payments for the first 54 months from the due date of the initial periodic payment, then requires fixed, fully amortizing payments of principal and interest for the duration of the loan, because the change in the periodic payment occurs on a date other than the anniversary of the due date of the initial periodic payment and the previous payment applies during that year, the creditor would likewise label the first disclosure of periodic payments as “Years 1-5” (including the term “only interest” pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i)) and the second disclosure of periodic payments or range of payments as “Years 6-30.” If the loan that requires interest only payments for the first 54 months also requires mortgage insurance that would automatically terminate under applicable law after the 100th month from the due date of the initial periodic payment, the creditor would label the first disclosure of periodic payments as “Years 1-5” (including the term “only interest” pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(i)), the second disclosure of periodic payments or range of payments as “Years 6-9,” and the third disclosure of periodic payments or range of payments as “Years 10-30.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-c-3-ii-Interp-2" id="37-c-3-ii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Loans with variable terms.</strong> If the loan term may increase based on an adjustment of the interest rate, the creditor must disclose the maximum loan term possible under the legal obligation. To calculate the maximum loan term, the creditor assumes that the interest rate rises as rapidly as possible, taking into account the terms of the legal obligation, including any applicable caps on interest rate adjustments and lifetime interest rate cap. <em>See</em> comment 37(a)(8)-2.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-f-1-Interp-1" id="37-f-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Origination charges.</strong> Charges included under the subheading “Origination Charges” pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(f)(1) are those charges paid by the consumer to each creditor and loan originator for originating and extending the credit, regardless of how such fees are denominated. In accordance with §&#160;1026.37(o)(4), the dollar amounts disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(f)(1) must be rounded to the nearest whole dollar and the percentage amounts must be disclosed as an exact number up to two or three decimal places, except that decimal places shall not be disclosed if the percentage is a whole number. See comment 19(e)(3)(i)-3 for a discussion of when a fee is considered to be “paid to” a person. See §&#160;1026.36(a) and associated commentary for a discussion of the meaning of “loan originator” in connection with limits on compensation in a consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-f-1-Interp-2" id="37-f-1-Interp-2">2. <strong>Indirect loan originator compensation.</strong> Only charges paid directly by the consumer to compensate a loan originator are included in the amounts listed under §&#160;1026.37(f)(1). Compensation of a loan originator paid indirectly by the creditor through the interest rate is not itemized on the Loan Estimate required by §&#160;1026.19(e). However, pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(f)(1), such compensation is itemized on the Closing Disclosure required by §&#160;1026.19(f).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-f-1-Interp-3" id="37-f-1-Interp-3">3. <strong>Description of charges.</strong> Other than for points charged in connection with the transaction to reduce the interest rate, for which specific language must be used, the creditor may use a general label that uses terminology that, under §&#160;1026.37(f)(5), is consistent with §&#160;1026.17(a)(1), clearly and conspicuously describes the service that is disclosed as an origination charge pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(f)(1). Items that are listed under the subheading “Origination Charges” may include, for example, application fee, origination fee, underwriting fee, processing fee, verification fee, and rate-lock fee.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-f-1-Interp-5" id="37-f-1-Interp-5">5. <strong>Itemization.</strong> Creditors determine the level of itemization of “Origination Charges” that is appropriate under §&#160;1026.37(f)(1) in relation to charges paid by the consumer to the creditor, subject to the limitations in §&#160;1026.37(f)(1)(ii). For example, the following charges should be itemized separately: compensation paid directly by a consumer to a loan originator that is not also the creditor; or a charge imposed to pay for a loan level pricing adjustment assessed on the creditor, which the creditor passes onto the consumer as a charge at consummation and not as an adjustment to the interest rate.</p>

Comment 19(e)(1)(vi)-1 clarifies that a consumer is not permitted to shop if the consumer must choose a provider from a list provided by the creditor. Comment 19(e)(3)(i)-1 addresses determining good faith in providing estimates under §&#160;1026.19(e), including estimates for services for which the consumer cannot shop.

Government funding fees include a United States Department of Veterans Affairs or United States Department of Agriculture guarantee fee, or any other fee paid to a government entity as part of a governmental loan program, that is paid at consummation.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-f-2-Interp-4" id="37-f-2-Interp-4">4. <strong>Lender's title insurance policy.</strong> Section 1026.37(f)(2) and (3) requires disclosure of the amount the consumer will pay for the lender's title insurance policy. However, an owner's title insurance policy that covers the consumer and is not required to be purchased by the creditor is only disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g). Accordingly, the creditor must quote the amount of the lender's title insurance coverage pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(f)(2) or (3) as applicable based on the type of lender's title insurance policy required by its underwriting standards for that loan. The amount disclosed for the lender's title insurance policy pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(f)(2) or (3) is the amount of the premium without any adjustment that might be made for the simultaneous purchase of an owner's title insurance policy. This amount may be disclosed as “Title - Premium for Lender's Coverage,” or in any similar manner that clearly indicates the amount of the premium disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(f)(2) is for the lender's title insurance coverage. See comment 37(g)(4)-1 for a discussion of the disclosure of the premium for an owner's title insurance policy that covers the consumer.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-1-Interp-1" id="37-g-1-Interp-1">1. <strong>Recording fees.</strong> Recording fees listed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(1) are fees assessed by a government authority to record and index the loan and title documents as required under State or local law. Recording fees are assessed based on the type of document to be recorded or its physical characteristics, such as the number of pages. Unlike transfer taxes, recording fees are not based on the sale price of the property or loan amount. For example, a fee for recording a subordination agreement that is $20, plus $3 for each page over three pages, is a recording fee, but a fee of $1,250 based on 0.5 percent of the loan amount is a transfer tax, and not a recording fee.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-1-Interp-2" id="37-g-1-Interp-2">2. <strong>Other government charges.</strong> Any charges or fees imposed by a State or local government that are not transfer taxes are aggregated with recording fees and disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-1-Interp-3" id="37-g-1-Interp-3">3. <strong>Transfer taxes - terminology.</strong> In general, transfer taxes listed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(1) are State and local government fees on mortgages and home sales that are based on the loan amount or sales price, while recording fees are State and local government fees for recording the loan and title documents. The name that is used under State or local law to refer to these amounts is not determinative of whether they are disclosed as transfer taxes or as recording fees and other taxes under §&#160;1026.37(g)(1).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-1-Interp-4" id="37-g-1-Interp-4">4. <strong>Transfer taxes - consumer.</strong> Only transfer taxes paid by the consumer are disclosed on the Loan Estimate pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g)(1). State and local government transfer taxes are governed by State or local law, which determines if the seller or consumer is ultimately responsible for paying the transfer taxes. For example, if State law indicates a lien can attach to the consumer's acquired property if the transfer tax is not paid, the transfer tax is disclosed. If State or local law is unclear or does not specifically attribute transfer taxes to the seller or the consumer, the creditor is in compliance with requirements of §&#160;1026.37(g)(1) if the amount of the transfer tax disclosed is not less than the amount apportioned to the consumer using common practice in the locality of the property.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-1-Interp-5" id="37-g-1-Interp-5">5. <strong>Transfer taxes - seller.</strong> Transfer taxes paid by the seller in a purchase transaction are not disclosed on the Loan Estimate under §&#160;1026.37(g)(1), but are disclosed on the Closing Disclosure pursuant to §&#160;1026.38(g)(1)(ii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-1-Interp-6" id="37-g-1-Interp-6">6. <strong>Deletion and addition of items.</strong> The lines and labels required by §&#160;1026.37(g)(1) may not be deleted, even if recording fees or transfer taxes are not charged to the consumer. No additional items may be listed under the subheading in §&#160;1026.37(g)(1).</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-4-Interp-1" id="37-g-4-Interp-1">1. <strong>Owner's title insurance policy rate.</strong> The amount disclosed for an owner's title insurance premium pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g)(4) is based on a basic owner's policy rate, and not on an “enhanced” title insurance policy premium, except that the creditor may instead disclose the premium for an “enhanced” policy when the “enhanced” title insurance policy is required by the real estate sales contract, if such requirement is known to the creditor when issuing the Loan Estimate. This amount should be disclosed as “Title - Owner's Title Policy (optional),” or in any similar manner that includes the introductory description “Title -” at the beginning of the label for the item, the parenthetical description “(optional)” at the end of the label, and clearly indicates the amount of the premium disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g)(4) is for the owner's title insurance coverage. See comment 37(f)(2)-4 for a discussion of the disclosure of the premium for lender's title insurance coverage.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-4-Interp-2" id="37-g-4-Interp-2">2. <strong>Simultaneous title insurance premium rate in purchase transactions.</strong> The premium for an owner's title insurance policy for which a special rate may be available based on the simultaneous issuance of a lender's and an owner's policy is calculated and disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g)(4) as follows:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-g-4-Interp-2-i" id="37-g-4-Interp-2-i">i. The title insurance premium for a lender's title policy is based on the full premium rate, consistent with §&#160;1026.37(f)(2) or (f)(3).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-g-4-Interp-2-ii" id="37-g-4-Interp-2-ii">ii. The owner's title insurance premium is calculated by taking the full owner's title insurance premium, adding the simultaneous issuance premium for the lender's coverage, and then deducting the full premium for lender's coverage.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-4-Interp-3" id="37-g-4-Interp-3">3. <strong>Designation of optional items.</strong> Products disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(4) for which the parenthetical description “(optional)” is included at the end of the label for the item include only items that are separate from any item disclosed on the Loan Estimate under paragraphs other than §&#160;1026.37(g)(4). For example, such items may include optional owner's title insurance, credit life insurance, debt suspension coverage, debt cancellation coverage, warranties of home appliances and systems, and similar products, when coverage is written in connection with a credit transaction that is subject to §&#160;1026.19(e). However, because the requirement in §&#160;1026.37(g)(4)(ii) applies to separate products only, additional coverage and endorsements on insurance otherwise required by the lender are not disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(4). See comments 4(b)(7) and (b)(8)-1 through -3 and comments 4(b)(10)-1 and -2 for guidance on determining when credit life insurance, debt suspension coverage, debt cancellation coverage, and similar coverage is written in connection with a transaction subject to §&#160;1026.19(e).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-g-4-Interp-4" id="37-g-4-Interp-4">4. <strong>Examples.</strong> Examples of other items that are disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(g)(4) if the creditor is aware of those items when it issues the Loan Estimate include commissions of real estate brokers or agents, additional payments to the seller to purchase personal property pursuant to the property contract, homeowner's association and condominium charges associated with the transfer of ownership, and fees for inspections not required by the creditor but paid by the consumer pursuant to the property contract. Although the consumer is obligated for these costs, they are not imposed upon the consumer by the creditor or loan originator. Therefore, they are not disclosed with the parenthetical description “(optional)” at the end of the label for the item, and they are disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(g) rather than §&#160;1026.37(f). Even if such items are not required to be disclosed on the Loan Estimate under §&#160;1026.37(g)(4), however, they may be required to be disclosed on the Closing Disclosure pursuant to §&#160;1026.38. Comment 19(e)(3)(iii)-3 discusses application of the good faith requirement for services chosen by the consumer that are not required by the creditor.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-Interp-1" id="37-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>When table is not permitted to be disclosed.</strong> The disclosure described in §&#160;1026.37(i) is required only if the periodic principal and interest payment may change after consummation based on a loan term other than a change to the interest rate, or the transaction contains a seasonal payment product feature as described in §&#160;1026.37(a)(10)(ii)(E). If the transaction does not contain such loan terms, this table shall not appear on the Loan Estimate.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-Interp-2" id="37-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>Periods to be disclosed.</strong> Section 1026.37(i)(1) through (4) requires disclosure of the periods during which interest only, optional payment, step payment, and seasonal payment product features will be in effect. The periods required to be disclosed should be disclosed by describing the number of payments counting from the first periodic payment due after consummation. The period of seasonal payments required to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.37(i)(4), to be clear and conspicuous, should be disclosed with a noun that identifies the unit-period, because such feature may apply on a regular basis during the loan term that does not depend on when regular periodic payments begin. The disclosures required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(1) through (4) may include abbreviations to fit in the space provided for the information on form H-24, provided the information is disclosed in a clear and conspicuous manner. For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-i-Interp-2-i" id="37-i-Interp-2-i">i. <strong>Period from date of consummation.</strong> If a loan has an interest only period for the first 60 regular periodic payments due after consummation, the disclosure states “for your first 60 payments.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-i-Interp-2-ii" id="37-i-Interp-2-ii">ii. <strong>Period during middle of loan term.</strong> If the loan has an interest only period between the 61st and 85th payments, the disclosure states “from your 61st to 85th payment.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-i-Interp-2-iii" id="37-i-Interp-2-iii">iii. <strong>Multiple successive periods.</strong> If there are multiple periods during which a certain adjustable payment term applies, such as a period of step payments that occurs from the first through 12th payments, does not occur from the 13th through 24th payments, and occurs again from the 25th through 36th payments, the period disclosed is the entire span of all such periods. Accordingly, such period is disclosed as “for your first 36 payments.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="37-i-Interp-2-iv" id="37-i-Interp-2-iv">iv. <strong>Seasonal payments.</strong> For a seasonal payment product with a unit-period of a month that does not require periodic payments for the months of June, July, and August each year during the loan term, because such feature depends on calendar months and not on when regular periodic payments begin, the period is disclosed as “from June to August.” For a transaction with a quarterly unit-period that does not require a periodic payment every third quarter during the loan term and does not depend on calendar months, the period is disclosed as “every third payment.” In the same transaction, if the seasonal payment feature ends after the 20th quarter, the period is disclosed as “every quarter until the 20th quarter.” As described above in this comment 37(i)-2, the creditor may abbreviate “quarter” to “quart.” or “Q.”</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-5-Interp-1" id="37-i-5-Interp-1">1. <strong>Statement of periodic payment frequency.</strong> The subheading required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) must include the unit-period of the transaction, such as “quarterly,” “bi-weekly,” or “annual.” This unit-period should be the same as disclosed under §&#160;1026.37(b)(3). <em>See</em> §&#160;1026.37(o)(5)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-5-Interp-2" id="37-i-5-Interp-2">2. <strong>Initial payment adjustment unknown.</strong> The disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) must state the number of the first payment for which the regular periodic principal and interest payment may change. This payment is typically set forth in the legal obligation. However, if the exact payment number of the first adjustment is not known at the time the creditor provides the Loan Estimate, the creditor must disclose the earliest possible payment that may change under the terms of the legal obligation, based on the information available to the creditor at the time, as the initial payment number and amount.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-5-Interp-3" id="37-i-5-Interp-3">3. <strong>Subsequent changes.</strong> The disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) must state the frequency of adjustments to the regular periodic principal and interest payment after the initial adjustment, if any, expressed in years, except if adjustments are more frequent than once every year, in which case the disclosure should be expressed as payments. If there is only one adjustment of the periodic payment under the terms of the legal obligation (for example, if the loan has an interest only period for the first 60 payments and there are no adjustments to the payment after the end of the interest only period), the disclosure should state: “No subsequent changes.” If the loan has graduated increases in the regular periodic payment every 12th payment, the disclosure should state: “Every year.” If the frequency of adjustments to the periodic payment may change under the terms of the legal obligation, the disclosure should state the smallest period of adjustments that may occur. For example, if an increase in the periodic payment is scheduled every sixth payment for 36 payments, and then every 12th payment for the next 24 payments, the disclosure should state: “Every 6th payment.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-5-Interp-4" id="37-i-5-Interp-4">4. <strong>Maximum payment.</strong> The disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) must state the larger of the maximum scheduled or maximum potential amount of a regular periodic principal and interest payment under the terms of the legal obligation, as well as the payment number of the first periodic principal and interest payment that can reach such amount. If the disclosed payment is scheduled, §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) requires that the disclosure state the payment number when such payment is reached with the preceding text, “starting at.” If the disclosed payment is only potential, as may be the case for a loan that permits optional payments, the disclosure states the earliest payment number when such payment can be reached with the preceding text, “as early as.” Section 1026.37(i)(5) requires that the first possible periodic principal and interest payment that can reach the maximum be disclosed. For example, for a fixed interest rate optional-payment loan with scheduled payments that result in negative amortization under the terms of the legal obligation, the maximum periodic payment disclosed should be based on the consumer having elected to make the periodic payments that would increase the principal balance to the maximum amount at the latest time possible before the loan begins to fully amortize, which would cause the periodic principal and interest payment to be the maximum possible. For example, if the earliest payment that could reach the maximum principal balance was the 41st payment at which time the loan would begin to amortize and the periodic principal and interest payment would be recalculated, but the last payment that permitted the principal balance to increase was the 60th payment, the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) must assume the consumer only reaches the maximum principal balance at the 60th payment because this would result in the maximum possible principal and interest payment under the terms of the legal obligation. The disclosure must state the maximum periodic principal and interest payment based on this assumption and state “as early as the 61st payment.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-i-5-Interp-5" id="37-i-5-Interp-5">5. <strong>Payments that do not pay principal.</strong> Although the label of the disclosure required by §&#160;1026.37(i)(5) is “Principal and Interest Payments,” and the section refers to periodic principal and interest payments, it includes a scheduled periodic payment that only covers some or all of the interest that is due and not any principal (<em>i.e.,</em> an interest only or negatively amortizing payment).</p>

The NMLSR ID is a unique number or other identifier generally assigned to individuals registered or licensed through NMLSR to provide loan originating services. For more information, see the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (SAFE Act) sections 1503(3) and (12) and 1504 (12 U.S.C. 5102(3) and (12) and 5103), and its implementing regulations (<em>i.e.,</em> 12 CFR 1007.103(a) and 1008.103(a)(2)). An entity may also have an NMLSR ID. Thus, if the creditor, mortgage broker, or loan officer has obtained an NMLSR ID, the NMLSR IDs must be provided in the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.37(k)(1) and (2).</p>

In such event, if the applicable State, locality, or other regulatory body with responsibility for licensing and/or registering such entity's or individual's business activities has issued a license number or other unique identifier to such entity or individual, that number is disclosed. In addition, §&#160;1026.37(k)(1) and (2) require the abbreviation of the State of the jurisdiction or regulatory body that issued such license or registration is required to be included before the word “License” in the label required by §&#160;1026.37(k)(1) and (2). If no such license or registration is required to be disclosed, such as if an NMLSR number is disclosed, the space provided for such an abbreviation in form H-24 of appendix H to this part may be left blank. A U.S. Postal Service State abbreviation complies with §&#160;1026.37(k)(1) and (2), if applicable.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-k-Interp-4" id="37-k-Interp-4">4. <strong>Email address and phone number.</strong> Section 1026.37(k)(3) requires disclosure of the loan officer's email address and phone number.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-m-2-Interp-1" id="37-m-2-Interp-1">1. <strong>Disclosure.</strong> Section 1026.37(m)(2) requires the creditor to disclose whether or not a third party may be allowed to assume the loan on its original terms if the property is sold or transferred by the consumer. In many cases, the creditor cannot determine, at the time the disclosure is made, whether a loan may be assumable at a future date on its original terms. For example, the assumption clause commonly used in mortgages sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation conditions an assumption on a variety of factors, such as the creditworthiness of the subsequent borrower, the potential for impairment of the creditor's security, and the execution of an assumption agreement by the subsequent borrower. If the creditor can determine that such assumption is not permitted, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(m)(2) by disclosing that the loan is not assumable. In all other situations, including where assumption of a loan is permitted or is dependent on certain conditions or factors, or uncertainty exists as to the future assumability of a mortgage loan, the creditor complies with §&#160;1026.37(m)(2) by disclosing that, under certain conditions, the creditor may allow a third party to assume the loan on its original terms.</p>

For example, §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(iv) requires disclosure of the total periodic payment labeled “Total Monthly Payment,” but the label on form H-24 contains the designation “Estimated” and thus, the label required by §&#160;1026.37(c)(2)(iv) must contain the designation “Estimated.” Although many of the disclosures required by §&#160;1026.38 cross-reference their counterparts in §&#160;1026.37, §&#160;1026.38(t) incorporates the “estimated” designations reflected on form H-25, not form H-24.</p>

Creditors in non-federally related mortgage loans making any changes that affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure will lose their protection from civil liability under TILA section 130.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-5-Interp-2" id="37-o-5-Interp-2">2. <strong>Manual completion.</strong> Section 1026.37(o) does not require the creditor to use a computer, typewriter, or other word processor to complete the disclosure form. The information and amounts required to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.37 on form H-24 of appendix H to this part may be filled in by hand printing or using any other method, provided the information is clear and legible and complies with the formatting required by form H-24, including replicating bold font where required.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-5-Interp-3" id="37-o-5-Interp-3">3. <strong>Contact information.</strong> If a transaction involves more than one creditor or mortgage broker, the space provided on form H-24 of appendix H to this part for the contact information required by §&#160;1026.37(m) may be altered to add additional labels to accommodate the additional information of such parties, provided that the information required by §&#160;1026.37(l), (m), and (n) are disclosed on the same page as illustrated by form H-24. If the space provided on form H-24 of appendix H to this part does not allow for the disclosure of such contact and other information on the same page, an additional page may be added to provide the required contact information with an appropriate reference to the additional page.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-5-Interp-4" id="37-o-5-Interp-4">4. <strong>Unit-period.</strong> Section 1026.37(o)(5)(i) provides that wherever form H-24 or §&#160;1026.37 uses “monthly” to describe the frequency of any payments or uses “month” to describe the applicable unit-period, the creditor is required to substitute the appropriate term to reflect the fact that the transaction's terms provide for other than monthly periodic payments, such as bi-weekly or quarterly payments. For purposes of §&#160;1026.37, the term “unit-period” has the same meaning as in appendix J to Regulation Z.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-5-Interp-5" id="37-o-5-Interp-5">5. <strong>Additional page.</strong> Information required or permitted to be disclosed by §&#160;1026.37 on a separate page should be formatted similarly to form H-24 of appendix H to this part, so as not to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure. In addition, information provided on additional pages should be consolidated on as few pages as necessary to not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="37-o-5-Interp-6" id="37-o-5-Interp-6">6. <strong>Translation.</strong> Section 1026.37(o)(5)(ii) permits the translation of form H-24 into languages other than English, consistent with §&#160;1026.27. Pursuant to §&#160;1026.37(o)(5)(ii) creditors may modify form H-24 to the extent that translation prevents the headings, labels, designations, and required disclosure items under §&#160;1026.37 from fitting in the space provided on form H-24. For example, if the translation of a required label does not fit within the line provided for such label in form H-24, the label may be disclosed over two lines. See form H-28 of appendix H to this part for Spanish translations of form H-24.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="o-5-i" id="o-5-i"><strong>(i) Unit-period.</strong> Wherever the form or this section uses “monthly” to describe the frequency of any payments or uses “month” to describe the applicable unit-period, the creditor shall substitute the appropriate term to reflect the fact that the transaction's terms provide for other than monthly periodic payments, such as bi-weekly or quarterly payments.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="o-5-ii" id="o-5-ii"><strong>(ii) Translation.</strong> The form may be translated into languages other than English, and creditors may modify form H-24 of appendix H to this part to the extent that translation prevents the headings, labels, designations, and required disclosure items under this section from fitting in the space provided on form H-24.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="o-5-iii" id="o-5-iii"><strong>(iii) Logo or slogan.</strong> The creditor providing the form may use a logo for, and include a slogan with, the information required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section in any font size or type, provided that such logo or slogan does not cause the information required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section to exceed the space provided for that information, as illustrated in form H-24 of appendix H to this part. If the creditor does not use a logo for the information required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the information shall be disclosed in a similar format as form H-24.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="o-5-iv" id="o-5-iv"><strong>(iv) Business card.</strong> The creditor may physically attach a business card over the information required to be disclosed by paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="o-5-v" id="o-5-v"><strong>(v) Administrative information.</strong> The creditor may insert at the bottom of each page under the disclosures required by this section as illustrated by form H-24 of appendix H to this part, any administrative information, text, or codes that assist in identification of the form or the information disclosed on the form, provided that the space provided on form H-24 of appendix H to this part for any of the information required by this section is not altered.</p>

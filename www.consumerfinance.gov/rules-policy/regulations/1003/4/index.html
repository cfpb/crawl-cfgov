<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-Interp-1" id="4-a-Interp-1">1. <strong>General.</strong> Except as otherwise provided in §&#160;1003.3, §&#160;1003.4(a) describes a financial institution's obligation to collect data on applications it received, on covered loans that it originated, and on covered loans that it purchased during the calendar year covered by the loan/application register.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-Interp-1-i" id="4-a-Interp-1-i">i. A financial institution reports these data even if the covered loans were subsequently sold by the institution.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-Interp-1-ii" id="4-a-Interp-1-ii">ii. A financial institution reports data for applications that did not result in an origination but on which actions were taken-for example, an application that the institution denied, that it approved but that was not accepted, that it closed for incompleteness, or that the applicant withdrew during the calendar year covered by the loan/application register. A financial institution is required to report data regarding requests under a preapproval program (as defined in §&#160;1003.2(b)(2)) only if the preapproval request is denied, results in the origination of a home purchase loan, or was approved but not accepted.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-Interp-1-iii" id="4-a-Interp-1-iii">iii. If a financial institution acquires covered loans in bulk from another institution (for example, from the receiver for a failed institution), but no merger or acquisition of an institution, or acquisition of a branch office, is involved, the acquiring financial institution reports the covered loans as purchased loans.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-Interp-1-iv" id="4-a-Interp-1-iv">iv. A financial institution reports the data for an application on the loan/application register for the calendar year during which the application was acted upon even if the institution received the application in a previous calendar year.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-Interp-2" id="4-a-Interp-2">2. <strong>Originations and applications involving more than one institution.</strong> Section 1003.4(a) requires a financial institution to collect certain information regarding applications for covered loans that it receives and regarding covered loans that it originates. The following provides guidance on how to report originations and applications involving more than one institution. The discussion below assumes that all of the parties are financial institutions as defined by §&#160;1003.2(g). The same principles apply if any of the parties is not a financial institution. Comment 4(a)-3 provides examples of transactions involving more than one institution, and comment 4(a)-4 discusses how to report actions taken by agents.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-Interp-2-i" id="4-a-Interp-2-i">i. Only one financial institution reports each originated covered loan as an origination. If more than one institution was involved in the origination of a covered loan, the financial institution that made the credit decision approving the application before closing or account opening reports the loan as an origination. It is not relevant whether the loan closed or, in the case of an application, would have closed in the institution's name. If more than one institution approved an application prior to closing or account opening and one of those institutions purchased the loan after closing, the institution that purchased the loan after closing reports the loan as an origination. If a financial institution reports a transaction as an origination, it reports all of the information required for originations, even if the covered loan was not initially payable to the financial institution that is reporting the covered loan as an origination.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-Interp-2-ii" id="4-a-Interp-2-ii">ii. In the case of an application for a covered loan that did not result in an origination, a financial institution reports the action it took on that application if it made a credit decision on the application or was reviewing the application when the application was withdrawn or closed for incompleteness. It is not relevant whether the financial institution received the application from the applicant or from another institution, such as a broker, or whether another financial institution also reviewed and reported an action taken on the same application.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-Interp-3" id="4-a-Interp-3">3. <strong>Examples - originations and applications involving more than one institution.</strong> The following scenarios illustrate how an institution reports a particular application or covered loan. The illustrations assume that all of the parties are financial institutions as defined by §&#160;1003.2(g). However, the same principles apply if any of the parties is not a financial institution.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-Interp-3-i" id="4-a-Interp-3-i">i. Financial Institution A received an application for a covered loan from an applicant and forwarded that application to Financial Institution B. Financial Institution B reviewed the application and approved the loan prior to closing. The loan closed in Financial Institution A's name. Financial Institution B purchased the loan from Financial Institution A after closing. Financial Institution B was not acting as Financial Institution A's agent. Since Financial Institution B made the credit decision prior to closing, Financial Institution B reports the transaction as an origination, not as a purchase. Financial Institution A does not report the transaction.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-Interp-3-ii" id="4-a-Interp-3-ii">ii. Financial Institution A received an application for a covered loan from an applicant and forwarded that application to Financial Institution B. Financial Institution B reviewed the application before the loan would have closed, but the application did not result in an origination because Financial Institution B denied the application. Financial Institution B was not acting as Financial Institution A's agent. Since Financial Institution B made the credit decision, Financial Institution B reports the application as a denial. Financial Institution A does not report the application. If, under the same facts, the application was withdrawn before Financial Institution B made a credit decision, Financial Institution B would report the application as withdrawn and Financial Institution A would not report the application.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-Interp-3-iii" id="4-a-Interp-3-iii">iii. Financial Institution A received an application for a covered loan from an applicant and approved the application before closing the loan in its name. Financial Institution A was not acting as Financial Institution B's agent. Financial Institution B purchased the covered loan from Financial Institution A. Financial Institution B did not review the application before closing. Financial Institution A reports the loan as an origination. Financial Institution B reports the loan as a purchase.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-Interp-3-iv" id="4-a-Interp-3-iv">iv. Financial Institution A received an application for a covered loan from an applicant. If approved, the loan would have closed in Financial Institution B's name. Financial Institution A denied the application without sending it to Financial Institution B for approval. Financial Institution A was not acting as Financial Institution B's agent. Since Financial Institution A made the credit decision before the loan would have closed, Financial Institution A reports the application. Financial Institution B does not report the application.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-Interp-3-v" id="4-a-Interp-3-v">v. Financial Institution A reviewed an application and made the credit decision to approve a covered loan using the underwriting criteria provided by a third party (<strong>e.g.,</strong> another financial institution, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac). The third party did not review the application and did not make a credit decision prior to closing. Financial Institution A was not acting as the third party's agent. Financial Institution A reports the application or origination. If the third party purchased the loan and is subject to Regulation C, the third party reports the loan as a purchase whether or not the third party reviewed the loan after closing. Assume the same facts, except that Financial Institution A approved the application, and the applicant chose not to accept the loan from Financial Institution A. Financial Institution A reports the application as approved but not accepted and the third party, assuming the third party is subject to Regulation C, does not report the application.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-Interp-3-vi" id="4-a-Interp-3-vi">vi. Financial Institution A reviewed and made the credit decision on an application based on the criteria of a third-party insurer or guarantor (for example, a government or private insurer or guarantor). Financial Institution A reports the action taken on the application.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-Interp-3-vii" id="4-a-Interp-3-vii">vii. Financial Institution A received an application for a covered loan and forwarded it to Financial Institutions B and C. Financial Institution A made a credit decision, acting as Financial Institution D's agent, and approved the application. The applicant did not accept the loan from Financial Institution D. Financial Institution D reports the application as approved but not accepted. Financial Institution A does not report the application. Financial Institution B made a credit decision, approving the application, the applicant accepted the offer of credit from Financial Institution B, and credit was extended. Financial Institution B reports the origination. Financial Institution C made a credit decision and denied the application. Financial Institution C reports the application as denied.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-Interp-4" id="4-a-Interp-4">4. <strong>Agents.</strong> If a financial institution made the credit decision on a covered loan or application through the actions of an agent, the institution reports the application or origination. State law determines whether one party is the agent of another. For example, acting as Financial Institution A's agent, Financial Institution B approved an application prior to closing and a covered loan was originated. Financial Institution A reports the loan as an origination.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-Interp-5" id="4-a-Interp-5">5. <strong>Purchased loans.</strong> i. A financial institution is required to collect data regarding covered loans it purchases. For purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a), a purchase includes a repurchase of a covered loan, regardless of whether the institution chose to repurchase the covered loan or was required to repurchase the covered loan because of a contractual obligation and regardless of whether the repurchase occurs within the same calendar year that the covered loan was originated or in a different calendar year. For example, assume that Financial Institution A originates or purchases a covered loan and then sells it to Financial Institution B, who later requires Financial Institution A to repurchase the covered loan pursuant to the relevant contractual obligations. Financial Institution B reports the purchase from Financial Institution A, assuming it is a financial institution as defined under §&#160;1003.2(g). Financial Institution A reports the repurchase from Financial Institution B as a purchase.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-Interp-ii" id="4-a-Interp-ii">ii. In contrast, for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a), a purchase does not include a temporary transfer of a covered loan to an interim funder or warehouse creditor as part of an interim funding agreement under which the originating financial institution is obligated to repurchase the covered loan for sale to a subsequent investor. Such agreements, often referred to as “repurchase agreements,” are sometimes employed as functional equivalents of warehouse lines of credit. Under these agreements, the interim funder or warehouse creditor acquires legal title to the covered loan, subject to an obligation of the originating institution to repurchase at a future date, rather than taking a security interest in the covered loan as under the terms of a more conventional warehouse line of credit. To illustrate, assume Financial Institution A has an interim funding agreement with Financial Institution B to enable Financial Institution B to originate loans. Assume further that Financial Institution B originates a covered loan and that, pursuant to this agreement, Financial Institution A takes a temporary transfer of the covered loan until Financial Institution B arranges for the sale of the covered loan to a subsequent investor and that Financial Institution B repurchases the covered loan to enable it to complete the sale to the subsequent investor (alternatively, Financial Institution A may transfer the covered loan directly to the subsequent investor at Financial Institution B's direction, pursuant to the interim funding agreement). The subsequent investor could be, for example, a financial institution or other entity that intends to hold the loan in portfolio, a GSE or other securitizer, or a financial institution or other entity that intends to package and sell multiple loans to a GSE or other securitizer. In this example, the temporary transfer of the covered loan from Financial Institution B to Financial Institution A is not a purchase, and any subsequent transfer back to Financial Institution B for delivery to the subsequent investor is not a purchase, for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a). Financial Institution B reports the origination of the covered loan as well as its sale to the subsequent investor. If the subsequent investor is a financial institution under §&#160;1003.2(g), it reports a purchase of the covered loan pursuant to §&#160;1003.4(a), regardless of whether it acquired the covered loan from Financial Institution B or directly from Financial Institution A.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-1-i-Interp-1" id="4-a-1-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>ULI - uniqueness.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(1)(i)(B)(<em>2</em>) requires a financial institution that assigns a universal loan identifier (ULI) to each covered loan or application (except as provided in §&#160;1003.4(a)(1)(i)(D) and (E)) to ensure that the character sequence it assigns is unique within the institution and used only for the covered loan or application. A financial institution should assign only one ULI to any particular covered loan or application, and each ULI should correspond to a single application and ensuing loan in the case that the application is approved and a loan is originated. A financial institution may use a ULI that was reported previously to refer only to the same loan or application for which the ULI was used previously or a loan that ensues from an application for which the ULI was used previously. A financial institution may not report an application for a covered loan in 2030 using the same ULI that was reported for a covered loan that was originated in 2020. Similarly, refinancings or applications for refinancing should be assigned a different ULI than the loan that is being refinanced. A financial institution with multiple branches must ensure that its branches do not use the same ULI to refer to multiple covered loans or applications.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-1-i-Interp-2" id="4-a-1-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>ULI - privacy.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(1)(i)(B)(<em>3</em>) prohibits a financial institution from including information that could be used to directly identify the applicant or borrower in the identifier that it assigns for the application or covered loan of the applicant or borrower. Information that could be used to directly identify the applicant or borrower includes, but is not limited to, the applicant's or borrower's name, date of birth, Social Security number, official government-issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, or employer or taxpayer identification number.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-1-i-Interp-3" id="4-a-1-i-Interp-3">3. <strong>ULI - purchased covered loan.</strong> If a financial institution has previously assigned a covered loan with a ULI or reported a covered loan with a ULI under this part, a financial institution that purchases that covered loan must report the same ULI that was previously assigned or reported unless the purchase of the covered loan is a partially exempt transaction under §&#160;1003.3(d). For example, if a financial institution that submits an annual loan/application register pursuant to §&#160;1003.5(a)(1)(i) originates a covered loan that is purchased by a financial institution that also submits an annual loan/application register pursuant to §&#160;1003.5(a)(1)(i), the financial institution that purchases the covered loan must report the purchase of the covered loan using the same ULI that was reported by the originating financial institution if the purchase is not a partially exempt transaction. If a financial institution that originates a covered loan has previously assigned the covered loan with a ULI under this part but has not yet reported the covered loan, a financial institution that purchases that covered loan must report the same ULI that was previously assigned if the purchase is not a partially exempt transaction. For example, if a financial institution that submits an annual loan/application register pursuant to §&#160;1003.5(a)(1)(i) (Institution A) originates a covered loan that is purchased by a financial institution that submits a quarterly loan/application register pursuant to §&#160;1003.5(a)(1)(ii) (Institution B) and Institution A assigned a ULI to the loan, then unless the purchase is a partially exempt transaction Institution B must report the ULI that was assigned by Institution A on Institution B’s quarterly loan/application register pursuant to §&#160;1003.5(a)(1)(ii), even though Institution A has not yet submitted its annual loan/application register pursuant to §&#160;1003.5(a)(1)(i). A financial institution that purchases a covered loan and is ineligible for a partial exemption with respect to the purchased covered loan must assign it a ULI pursuant to §&#160;1003.4(a)(1)(i) and report it pursuant to §&#160;1003.5(a)(1)(i) or (ii), whichever is applicable, if the covered loan was not assigned a ULI by the financial institution that originated the loan because, for example, the loan was originated prior to January 1, 2018, the loan was originated by an institution not required to report under this part, or the loan was assigned a non-universal loan identifier (NULI) under §&#160;1003.3(d)(5) rather than a ULI by the loan originator.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-1-i-Interp-4" id="4-a-1-i-Interp-4">4. <strong>ULI - reinstated or reconsidered application.</strong> A financial institution may, at its option, report a ULI previously reported under this part if, during the same calendar year, an applicant asks the institution to reinstate a counteroffer that the applicant previously did not accept or asks the financial institution to reconsider an application that was previously denied, withdrawn, or closed for incompleteness. For example, if a financial institution reports a denied application in its second-quarter 2020 data submission, pursuant to §&#160;1003.5(a)(1)(ii), but then reconsiders the application, resulting in an origination in the third quarter of 2020, the financial institution may report the origination in its third-quarter 2020 data submission using the same ULI that was reported for the denied application in its second-quarter 2020 data submission, so long as the financial institution treats the origination as the same transaction for reporting. However, a financial institution may not use a ULI previously reported if it reinstates or reconsiders an application that was reported in a prior calendar year. For example, if a financial institution reports a denied application that is not partially exempt in its fourth-quarter 2020 data submission, pursuant to §&#160;1003.5(a)(1)(ii), but then reconsiders the application, resulting in an origination that is not partially exempt in the first quarter of 2021, the financial institution reports a denied application under the original ULI in its fourth-quarter 2020 data submission and an origination with a different ULI in its first-quarter 2021 data submission, pursuant to §&#160;1003.5(a)(1)(ii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-1-i-Interp-5" id="4-a-1-i-Interp-5">5. <strong>ULI - check digit.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(1)(i)(C) requires that the two right-most characters in the ULI represent the check digit. Appendix C prescribes the requirements for generating a check digit and validating a ULI.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-1-i-Interp-6" id="4-a-1-i-Interp-6">6. <strong>NULI.</strong> For a partially exempt transaction under §&#160;1003.3(d), a financial institution may report a ULI or a NULI. See §&#160;1003.3(d)(5) and comments 3(d)(5)-1 and -2 for guidance on the NULI.</p>

For example, a lender could use a check-box or a purpose line on a loan application to determine whether the applicant intends to use covered loan proceeds for home improvement purposes. If an applicant provides no statement as to the proposed use of covered loan proceeds and the covered loan is not a home purchase loan, cash-out refinancing, or refinancing, a financial institution reports the covered loan as for a purpose other than home purchase, home improvement, refinancing, or cash-out refinancing for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(3).</p>

A financial institution reports a covered loan or an application as a cash-out refinancing if it is a refinancing as defined by §&#160;1003.2(p) and the institution considered it to be a cash-out refinancing in processing the application or setting the terms (such as the interest rate or origination charges) under its guidelines or an investor's guidelines.

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-3-Interp-2-i" id="4-a-3-Interp-2-i">i. Assume a financial institution considers an application for a loan product to be a cash-out refinancing under an investor's guidelines because of the amount of cash received by the borrower at closing or account opening. Assume also that under the investor's guidelines, the applicant qualifies for the loan product and the financial institution approves the application, originates the covered loan, and sets the terms of the covered loan consistent with the loan product. In this example, the financial institution would report the covered loan as a cash-out refinancing for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(3).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-3-Interp-2-ii" id="4-a-3-Interp-2-ii">ii. Assume a financial institution does not consider an application for a covered loan to be a cash-out refinancing under its own guidelines because the amount of cash received by the borrower does not exceed a certain threshold. Assume also that the institution approves the application, originates the covered loan, and sets the terms of the covered loan consistent with its own guidelines applicable to refinancings other than cash-out refinancings. In this example, the financial institution would report the covered loan as a refinancing for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(3).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-3-Interp-2-iii" id="4-a-3-Interp-2-iii">iii. Assume a financial institution does not distinguish between a cash-out refinancing and a refinancing under its own guidelines, and sets the terms of all refinancings without regard to the amount of cash received by the borrower at closing or account opening, and does not offer loan products under investor guidelines. In this example, the financial institution reports all covered loans and applications for covered loans that are defined by §&#160;1003.2(p) as refinancings for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(3).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-3-Interp-3" id="4-a-3-Interp-3">3. <strong>Purpose - multiple-purpose loan.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(3) requires a financial institution to report the purpose of a covered loan or application. If a covered loan is a home purchase loan as well as a home improvement loan, a refinancing, or a cash-out refinancing, an institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(3) by reporting the loan as a home purchase loan. If a covered loan is a home improvement loan as well as a refinancing or cash-out refinancing, but the covered loan is not a home purchase loan, an institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(3) by reporting the covered loan as a refinancing or a cash-out refinancing, as appropriate. If a covered loan is a refinancing or cash-out refinancing as well as for another purpose, such as for the purpose of paying educational expenses, but the covered loan is not a home purchase loan, an institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(3) by reporting the covered loan as a refinancing or a cash-out refinancing, as appropriate. <em>See</em> comment 4(a)(3)-2. If a covered loan is a home improvement loan as well as for another purpose, but the covered loan is not a home purchase loan, a refinancing, or cash-out refinancing, an institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(3) by reporting the covered loan as a home improvement loan. <em>See</em> comment 2(i)-1.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-3-Interp-4" id="4-a-3-Interp-4">4. <strong>Purpose - other.</strong> If a covered loan is not, or an application is not for, a home purchase loan, a home improvement loan, a refinancing, or a cash-out refinancing, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(3) by reporting the covered loan or application as for a purpose other than home purchase, home improvement, refinancing, or cash-out refinancing. For example, if a covered loan is for the purpose of paying educational expenses, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(3) by reporting the covered loan as for a purpose other than home purchase, home improvement, refinancing, or cash-out refinancing. Section 1003.4(a)(3) also requires an institution to report a covered loan or application as for a purpose other than home purchase, home improvement, refinancing, or cash-out refinancing if it is a refinancing but, under the terms of the agreement, the financial institution was unconditionally obligated to refinance the obligation subject to conditions within the borrower's control.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-3-Interp-5" id="4-a-3-Interp-5">5. <strong>Purpose - business or commercial purpose loans.</strong> If a covered loan primarily is for a business or commercial purpose as described in §&#160;1003.3(c)(10) and comment 3(c)(10)-2 and is a home purchase loan, home improvement loan, or a refinancing, §&#160;1003.4(a)(3) requires the financial institution to report the applicable loan purpose. If a loan primarily is for a business or commercial purpose but is not a home purchase loan, home improvement loan, or a refinancing, the loan is an excluded transaction under §&#160;1003.3(c)(10).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-3-Interp-6" id="4-a-3-Interp-6">6. <strong>Purpose - purchased loans.</strong> For purchased covered loans where origination took place prior to January 1, 2018, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(3) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</p>

If an application or covered loan did not involve a request for a preapproval of a home purchase loan under a preapproval program as defined by §&#160;1003.2(b)(2), a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(4) by reporting that the application or covered loan did not involve such a request, regardless of whether the institution has such a program and the applicant did not apply through that program or the institution does not have a preapproval program as defined by §&#160;1003.2(b)(2).</p>

Modular homes comply with local or other recognized buildings codes rather than standards established by the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act, 42 U.S.C. 5401 <em>et seq.</em> Modular homes are not required to have HUD Certification Labels under 24 CFR 3280.11 or data plates under 24 CFR 3280.5. Modular homes may have a certification from a State licensing agency that documents compliance with State or other applicable building codes. On-frame modular homes are constructed on permanent metal chassis similar to those used in manufactured homes. The chassis are not removed on site and are secured to the foundation. Off-frame modular homes typically have floor construction similar to the construction of other site-built homes, and the construction typically includes wooden floor joists and does not include permanent metal chassis. Dwellings built using prefabricated components assembled at the dwelling's permanent site should also be reported with a construction method of site-built.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-6-Interp-2" id="4-a-6-Interp-2">2. <strong>Principal residence.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(6) requires a financial institution to identify whether the property to which the covered loan or application relates is or will be used as a residence that the applicant or borrower physically occupies and uses, or will occupy and use, as his or her principal residence. For purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(6), an applicant or borrower can have only one principal residence at a time. Thus, a vacation or other second home would not be a principal residence. However, if an applicant or borrower buys or builds a new dwelling that will become the applicant's or borrower's principal residence within a year or upon the completion of construction, the new dwelling is considered the principal residence for purposes of applying this definition to a particular transaction.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-6-Interp-3" id="4-a-6-Interp-3">3. <strong>Second residences.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(6) requires a financial institution to identify whether the property to which the loan or application relates is or will be used as a second residence. For purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(6), a property is a second residence of an applicant or borrower if the property is or will be occupied by the applicant or borrower for a portion of the year and is not the applicant's or borrower's principal residence. For example, if a person purchases a property, occupies the property for a portion of the year, and rents the property for the remainder of the year, the property is a second residence for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(6). Similarly, if a couple occupies a property near their place of employment on weekdays, but the couple returns to their principal residence on weekends, the property near the couple's place of employment is a second residence for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(6).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-6-Interp-4" id="4-a-6-Interp-4">4. <strong>Investment properties.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(6) requires a financial institution to identify whether the property to which the covered loan or application relates is or will be used as an investment property. For purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(6), a property is an investment property if the borrower does not, or the applicant will not, occupy the property. For example, if a person purchases a property, does not occupy the property, and generates income by renting the property, the property is an investment property for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(6). Similarly, if a person purchases a property, does not occupy the property, and does not generate income by renting the property, but intends to generate income by selling the property, the property is an investment property for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(6). Section 1003.4(a)(6) requires a financial institution to identify a property as an investment property if the borrower or applicant does not or will not occupy the property, even if the borrower or applicant does not consider the property as owned for investment purposes. For example, if a corporation purchases a property that is a dwelling under §&#160;1003.2(f), that it does not occupy, but that is for the long-term residential use of its employees, the property is an investment property for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(6), even if the corporation considers the property as owned for business purposes rather than investment purposes, does not generate income by renting the property, and does not intend to generate income by selling the property at some point in time. If the property is for transitory use by employees, the property would not be considered a dwelling under §&#160;1003.2(f). <em>See</em> comment 2(f)-3.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-1" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>Action taken - covered loan originated.</strong> A financial institution reports that the covered loan was originated if the financial institution made a credit decision approving the application before closing or account opening and that credit decision results in an extension of credit. The same is true for an application that began as a request for a preapproval that subsequently results in a covered loan being originated. <em>See</em> comments 4(a)-2 through -4 for guidance on transactions in which more than one institution is involved.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-2" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>Action taken - covered loan purchased.</strong> A financial institution reports that the covered loan was purchased if the covered loan was purchased by the financial institution after closing or account opening and the financial institution did not make a credit decision on the application prior to closing or account opening, or if the financial institution did make a credit decision on the application prior to closing or account opening, but is repurchasing the loan from another entity that the loan was sold to. <em>See</em> comment 4(a)-5. <em>See</em> comments 4(a)-2 through -4 for guidance on transactions in which more than one financial institution is involved.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-3" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-3">3. <strong>Action taken - application approved but not accepted.</strong> A financial institution reports application approved but not accepted if the financial institution made a credit decision approving the application before closing or account opening, subject solely to outstanding conditions that are customary commitment or closing conditions, but the applicant or the party that initially received the application fails to respond to the financial institution's approval within the specified time, or the closed-end mortgage loan was not otherwise consummated or the account was not otherwise opened. <em>See</em> comment 4(a)(8)(i)-13.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-4" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-4">4. <strong>Action taken - application denied.</strong> A financial institution reports that the application was denied if it made a credit decision denying the application before an applicant withdraws the application or the file is closed for incompleteness. <em>See</em> comments 4(a)-2 through -4 for guidance on transactions in which more than one institution is involved.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-5" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-5">5. <strong>Action taken - application withdrawn.</strong> A financial institution reports that the application was withdrawn when the application is expressly withdrawn by the applicant before the financial institution makes a credit decision denying the application, before the financial institution makes a credit decision approving the application, or before the file is closed for incompleteness. A financial institution also reports application withdrawn if the financial institution provides a conditional approval specifying underwriting or creditworthiness conditions, pursuant to comment 4(a)(8)(i)-13, and the application is expressly withdrawn by the applicant before the applicant satisfies all specified underwriting or creditworthiness conditions. A preapproval request that is withdrawn is not reportable under HMDA. <em>See</em> §&#160;1003.4(a).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-6" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-6">6. <strong>Action taken - file closed for incompleteness.</strong> A financial institution reports that the file was closed for incompleteness if the financial institution sent a written notice of incompleteness under Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.9(c)(2), and the applicant did not respond to the request for additional information within the period of time specified in the notice before the applicant satisfies all underwriting or creditworthiness conditions. <em>See</em> comment 4(a)(8)(i)-13. If a financial institution then provides a notification of adverse action on the basis of incompleteness under Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.9(c)(1)(i), the financial institution may report the action taken as either file closed for incompleteness or application denied. A preapproval request that is closed for incompleteness is not reportable under HMDA. <em>See</em> §&#160;1003.4(a) and comment 4(a)-1.ii.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-7" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-7">7. <strong>Action taken - preapproval request denied.</strong> A financial institution reports that the preapproval request was denied if the application was a request for a preapproval under a preapproval program as defined in §&#160;1003.2(b)(2) and the institution made a credit decision denying the preapproval request.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-8" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-8">8. <strong>Action taken - preapproval request approved but not accepted.</strong> A financial institution reports that the preapproval request was approved but not accepted if the application was a request for a preapproval under a preapproval program as defined in §&#160;1003.2(b)(2) and the institution made a credit decision approving the preapproval request but the application did not result in a covered loan originated by the financial institution.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-9" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-9">9. <strong>Action taken - counteroffers.</strong> If a financial institution makes a counteroffer to lend on terms different from the applicant's initial request (for example, for a shorter loan maturity, with a different interest rate, or in a different amount) and the applicant declines to proceed with the counteroffer or fails to respond, the institution reports the action taken as a denial on the original terms requested by the applicant. If the applicant agrees to proceed with consideration of the financial institution's counteroffer, the financial institution reports the action taken as the disposition of the application based on the terms of the counteroffer. For example, assume a financial institution makes a counteroffer, the applicant agrees to proceed with the terms of the counteroffer, and the financial institution then makes a credit decision approving the application conditional on satisfying underwriting or creditworthiness conditions, and the applicant expressly withdraws before satisfying all underwriting or creditworthiness conditions and before the institution denies the application or closes the file for incompleteness. The financial institution reports the action taken as application withdrawn in accordance with comment 4(a)(8)(i)-13.i. Similarly, assume a financial institution makes a counteroffer, the applicant agrees to proceed with consideration of the counteroffer, and the financial institution provides a conditional approval stating the conditions to be met to originate the counteroffer. The financial institution reports the action taken on the application in accordance with comment 4(a)(8)(i)-13 regarding conditional approvals.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-10" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-10">10. <strong>Action taken - rescinded transactions.</strong> If a borrower rescinds a transaction after closing and before a financial institution is required to submit its loan/application register containing the information for the transaction under §&#160;1003.5(a), the institution reports the transaction as an application that was approved but not accepted.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-11" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-11">11. <strong>Action taken - purchased covered loans.</strong> An institution reports the covered loans that it purchased during the calendar year. An institution does not report the covered loans that it declined to purchase, unless, as discussed in comments 4(a)-2 through -4, the institution reviewed the application prior to closing, in which case it reports the application or covered loan according to comments 4(a)-2 through -4.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-12" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-12">12. <strong>Action taken - repurchased covered loans.</strong> See comment 4(a)-5 regarding reporting requirements when a covered loan is repurchased by the originating financial institution.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-13" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-13">13. <strong>Action taken - conditional approvals.</strong> If an institution issues an approval other than a commitment pursuant to a preapproval program as defined under §&#160;1003.2(b)(2), and that approval is subject to the applicant meeting certain conditions, the institution reports the action taken as provided below dependent on whether the conditions are solely customary commitment or closing conditions or if the conditions include any underwriting or creditworthiness conditions.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-13-i" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-13-i">i. <strong>Action taken examples.</strong> If the approval is conditioned on satisfying underwriting or creditworthiness conditions and they are not met, the institution reports the action taken as a denial. If, however, the conditions involve submitting additional information about underwriting or creditworthiness that the institution needs to make the credit decision, and the institution has sent a written notice of incompleteness under Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.9(c)(2), and the applicant did not respond within the period of time specified in the notice, the institution reports the action taken as file closed for incompleteness. <em>See</em> comment 4(a)(8)(i)-6. If the conditions are solely customary commitment or closing conditions and the conditions are not met, the institution reports the action taken as approved but not accepted. If all the conditions (underwriting, creditworthiness, or customary commitment or closing conditions) are satisfied and the institution agrees to extend credit but the covered loan is not originated, the institution reports the action taken as application approved but not accepted. If the applicant expressly withdraws before satisfying all underwriting or creditworthiness conditions and before the institution denies the application or closes the file for incompleteness, the institution reports the action taken as application withdrawn. If all underwriting and creditworthiness conditions have been met, and the outstanding conditions are solely customary commitment or closing conditions and the applicant expressly withdraws before the covered loan is originated, the institution reports the action taken as application approved but not accepted.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-13-ii" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-13-ii">ii. <strong>Customary commitment or closing conditions.</strong> Customary commitment or closing conditions include, for example: a clear-title requirement, an acceptable property survey, acceptable title insurance binder, clear termite inspection, a subordination agreement from another lienholder, and, where the applicant plans to use the proceeds from the sale of one home to purchase another, a settlement statement showing adequate proceeds from the sale.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-13-iii" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-13-iii">iii. <strong>Underwriting or creditworthiness conditions.</strong> Underwriting or creditworthiness conditions include, for example: conditions that constitute a counter-offer, such as a demand for a higher down-payment; satisfactory debt-to-income or loan-to-value ratios, a determination of need for private mortgage insurance, or a satisfactory appraisal requirement; or verification or confirmation, in whatever form the institution requires, that the applicant meets underwriting conditions concerning applicant creditworthiness, including documentation or verification of income or assets.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-i-Interp-14" id="4-a-8-i-Interp-14">14. <strong>Action taken - pending applications.</strong> An institution does not report any covered loan application still pending at the end of the calendar year; it reports that application on its loan/application register for the year in which final action is taken.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-ii-Interp-1" id="4-a-8-ii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Action taken date - general.</strong> A financial institution reports the date of the action taken.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-ii-Interp-2" id="4-a-8-ii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Action taken date - applications denied and files closed for incompleteness.</strong> For applications, including requests for a preapproval, that are denied or for files closed for incompleteness, the financial institution reports either the date the action was taken or the date the notice was sent to the applicant.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-ii-Interp-3" id="4-a-8-ii-Interp-3">3. <strong>Action taken date - application withdrawn.</strong> For applications withdrawn, the financial institution may report the date the express withdrawal was received or the date shown on the notification form in the case of a written withdrawal.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-ii-Interp-4" id="4-a-8-ii-Interp-4">4. <strong>Action taken date - approved but not accepted.</strong> For a covered loan approved by an institution but not accepted by the applicant, the institution reports any reasonable date, such as the approval date, the deadline for accepting the offer, or the date the file was closed. Although an institution need not choose the same approach for its entire HMDA submission, it should be generally consistent (such as by routinely using one approach within a particular division of the institution or for a category of covered loans).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-8-ii-Interp-5" id="4-a-8-ii-Interp-5">5. <strong>Action taken date - originations.</strong> For covered loan originations, including a preapproval request that leads to an origination by the financial institution, an institution generally reports the closing or account opening date. For covered loan originations that an institution acquires from a party that initially received the application, the institution reports either the closing or account opening date, or the date the institution acquired the covered loan from the party that initially received the application. If the disbursement of funds takes place on a date later than the closing or account opening date, the institution may use the date of initial disbursement. For a construction/permanent covered loan, the institution reports either the closing or account opening date, or the date the covered loan converts to the permanent financing. Although an institution need not choose the same approach for its entire HMDA submission, it should be generally consistent (such as by routinely using one approach within a particular division of the institution or for a category of covered loans). Notwithstanding this flexibility regarding the use of the closing or account opening date in connection with reporting the date action was taken, the institution must report the origination as occurring in the year in which the origination goes to closing or the account is opened.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-9-Interp-1" id="4-a-9-Interp-1">1. <strong>Multiple properties with one property taken as security.</strong> If a covered loan is related to more than one property, but only one property is taken as security (or, in the case of an application, proposed to be taken as security), a financial institution reports the information required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) for the property taken as or proposed to be taken as security. A financial institution does not report the information required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) for the property or properties related to the loan that are not taken as or proposed to be taken as security. For example, if a covered loan is secured by property A, and the proceeds are used to purchase or rehabilitate (or to refinance home purchase or home improvement loans related to) property B, the institution reports the information required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) for property A and does not report the information required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) for property B.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-9-Interp-2" id="4-a-9-Interp-2">2. <strong>Multiple properties with more than one property taken as security.</strong> If more than one property is taken or, in the case of an application, proposed to be taken as security for a single covered loan, a financial institution reports the covered loan or application in a single entry on its loan/application register and provides the information required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) for one of the properties taken as security that contains a dwelling. A financial institution does not report information about the other properties taken as security. If an institution is required to report specific information about the property identified in §&#160;1003.4(a)(9), the institution reports the information that relates to the property identified in §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) (or, if the transaction is partially exempt under §&#160;1003.3(d) and no data are reported pursuant to §&#160;1003.4(a)(9), the property that the institution would have identified in §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) if the transaction were not partially exempt). For example, Financial Institution A originated a covered loan that is secured by both property A and property B, each of which contains a dwelling. Financial Institution A reports the loan as one entry on its loan/application register, reporting the information required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) for either property A or property B. If Financial Institution A elects to report the information required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) about property A, Financial Institution A also reports the information required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(5), (6), (14), (29), and (30) related to property A. For aspects of the entries that do not refer to the property identified in §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) (<em>i.e.,</em> §&#160;1003.4(a)(1) through (4), (7), (8), (10) through (13), (15) through (28), (31) through (38)), Financial Institution A reports the information applicable to the covered loan or application and not information that relates only to the property identified in §&#160;1003.4(a)(9).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-9-Interp-3" id="4-a-9-Interp-3">3. <strong>Multifamily dwellings.</strong> A single multifamily dwelling may have more than one postal address. For example, three apartment buildings, each with a different street address, comprise a single multifamily dwelling that secures a covered loan. For the purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(9), a financial institution reports the information required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) in the same manner described in comment 4(a)(9)-2.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-9-Interp-4" id="4-a-9-Interp-4">4. <strong>Loans purchased from another institution.</strong> The requirement to report the property location information required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) applies not only to applications and originations but also to purchased covered loans.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-9-Interp-5" id="4-a-9-Interp-5">5. <strong>Manufactured home.</strong> If the site of a manufactured home has not been identified, a financial institution complies by reporting that the information required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) is not applicable.</p>

The address should correspond to the property identified on the legal obligation related to the covered loan. For applications that did not result in an origination, the address should correspond to the location of the property proposed to secure the loan as identified by the applicant. For example, assume a loan is secured by a property located at 123 Main Street, and the applicant's or borrower's mailing address is a post office box. The financial institution should not report the post office box, and should report 123 Main Street.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-9-i-Interp-2" id="4-a-9-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>Property address - format.</strong> A financial institution complies with the requirements in §&#160;1003.4(a)(9)(i) by reporting the following information about the physical location of the property securing the loan.</p>

For example, 100 N Main ST Apt 1.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-9-i-Interp-2-ii" id="4-a-9-i-Interp-2-ii">ii. <strong>City name.</strong> A financial institution complies by reporting the name of the city in which the property is located.</p>

For example, for a transaction involving a trust, a financial institution reports that the requirement to report the applicant's age is not applicable if the trust is the applicant.

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-10-iii-Interp-1" id="4-a-10-iii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Income data - income relied on.</strong> When a financial institution evaluates income as part of a credit decision, it reports the gross annual income relied on in making the credit decision. For example, if an institution relies on an applicant's salary to compute a debt-to-income ratio but also relies on the applicant's annual bonus to evaluate creditworthiness, the institution reports the salary and the bonus to the extent relied upon. If an institution relies on only a portion of an applicant's income in its determination, it does not report that portion of income not relied on. For example, if an institution, pursuant to lender and investor guidelines, does not rely on an applicant's commission income because it has been earned for less than 12 months, the institution does not include the applicant's commission income in the income reported. Likewise, if an institution relies on the verified gross income of the applicant in making the credit decision, then the institution reports the verified gross income. Similarly, if an institution relies on the income of a cosigner to evaluate creditworthiness, the institution includes the cosigner's income to the extent relied upon. An institution, however, does not include the income of a guarantor who is only secondarily liable.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-10-iii-Interp-2" id="4-a-10-iii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Income data - co-applicant.</strong> If two persons jointly apply for a covered loan and both list income on the application, but the financial institution relies on the income of only one applicant in evaluating creditworthiness, the institution reports only the income relied on.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-10-iii-Interp-3" id="4-a-10-iii-Interp-3">3. <strong>Income data - loan to employee.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(10)(iii) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable for a covered loan to, or an application from, its employee to protect the employee's privacy, even though the institution relied on the employee's income in making the credit decision.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-10-iii-Interp-4" id="4-a-10-iii-Interp-4">4. <strong>Income data - assets.</strong> A financial institution does not include as income amounts considered in making a credit decision based on factors that an institution relies on in addition to income, such as amounts derived from underwriting calculations of the potential annuitization or depletion of an applicant's remaining assets. Actual distributions from retirement accounts or other assets that are relied on by the financial institution as income should be reported as income. The interpretation of income in this paragraph does not affect §&#160;1003.4(a)(23), which requires, except for purchased covered loans, the collection of the ratio of the applicant's or borrower's total monthly debt to the total monthly income relied on in making the credit decision.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-10-iii-Interp-5" id="4-a-10-iii-Interp-5">5. <strong>Income data - credit decision not made.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(10)(iii) requires a financial institution to report the gross annual income relied on in processing the application if a credit decision was not made. For example, assume an institution received an application that included an applicant's self-reported income, but the application was withdrawn before a credit decision that would have considered income was made. The financial institution reports the income information relied on in processing the application at the time that the application was withdrawn or the file was closed for incompleteness.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-10-iii-Interp-6" id="4-a-10-iii-Interp-6">6. <strong>Income data - credit decision not requiring consideration of income.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(10)(iii) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable if the application did not or would not have required a credit decision that considered income under the financial institution's policies and procedures. For example, if the financial institution's policies and procedures do not consider income for a streamlined refinance program, the institution reports that the requirement is not applicable, even if the institution received income information from the applicant.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-10-iii-Interp-7" id="4-a-10-iii-Interp-7">7. <strong>Income data - non-natural person.</strong> A financial institution reports that the requirement is not applicable when the applicant or co-applicant is not a natural person (<em>e.g.,</em> a corporation, partnership, or trust). For example, for a transaction involving a trust, a financial institution reports that the requirement to report income data is not applicable if the trust is the applicant. On the other hand, if the applicant is a natural person, and is the beneficiary of a trust, a financial institution is required to report the information described in §&#160;1003.4(a)(10)(iii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-10-iii-Interp-8" id="4-a-10-iii-Interp-8">8. <strong>Income data - multifamily properties.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(10)(iii) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable when the covered loan is secured by, or application is proposed to be secured by, a multifamily dwelling.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-10-iii-Interp-9" id="4-a-10-iii-Interp-9">9. <strong>Income data - purchased loans.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(10)(iii) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable when reporting a purchased covered loan for which the institution chooses not to report the income.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-10-iii-Interp-10" id="4-a-10-iii-Interp-10">10. <strong>Income data - rounding.</strong> A financial institution complies by reporting the dollar amount of the income in thousands, rounded to the nearest thousand ($500 rounds up to the next $1,000). For example, $35,500 is reported as 36.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-11-Interp-1" id="4-a-11-Interp-1">1. <strong>Type of purchaser - loan-participation interests sold to more than one entity.</strong> A financial institution that originates a covered loan, and then sells it to more than one entity, reports the “type of purchaser” based on the entity purchasing the greatest interest, if any. For purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(11), if a financial institution sells some interest or interests in a covered loan but retains a majority interest in that loan, it does not report the sale.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-11-Interp-2" id="4-a-11-Interp-2">2. <strong>Type of purchaser - swapped covered loans.</strong> Covered loans “swapped” for mortgage-backed securities are to be treated as sales; the purchaser is the entity receiving the covered loans that are swapped.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-11-Interp-3" id="4-a-11-Interp-3">3. <strong>Type of purchaser - affiliate institution.</strong> For purposes of complying with §&#160;1003.4(a)(11), the term “affiliate” means any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, another company, as set forth in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841 <em>et seq.</em>).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-11-Interp-4" id="4-a-11-Interp-4">4. <strong>Type of purchaser - private securitizations.</strong> A financial institution that knows or reasonably believes that the covered loan it is selling will be securitized by the entity purchasing the covered loan, other than by one of the government-sponsored enterprises, reports the purchasing entity type as a private securitizer regardless of the type or affiliation of the purchasing entity. Knowledge or reasonable belief could, for example, be based on the purchase agreement or other related documents, the financial institution's previous transactions with the purchaser, or the purchaser's role as a securitizer (such as an investment bank). If a financial institution selling a covered loan does not know or reasonably believe that the purchaser will securitize the loan, and the seller knows that the purchaser frequently holds or disposes of loans by means other than securitization, then the financial institution should report the covered loan as purchased by, as appropriate, a commercial bank, savings bank, savings association, life insurance company, credit union, mortgage company, finance company, affiliate institution, or other type of purchaser.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-11-Interp-5" id="4-a-11-Interp-5">5. <strong>Type of purchaser - mortgage company.</strong> For purposes of complying with §&#160;1003.4(a)(11), a mortgage company means a nondepository institution that purchases covered loans and typically originates such loans. A mortgage company might be an affiliate or a subsidiary of a bank holding company or thrift holding company, or it might be an independent mortgage company. Regardless, a financial institution reports the purchasing entity type as a mortgage company, unless the mortgage company is an affiliate of the seller institution, in which case the seller institution should report the loan as purchased by an affiliate institution.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-11-Interp-6" id="4-a-11-Interp-6">6. <strong>Purchases by subsidiaries.</strong> A financial institution that sells a covered loan to its subsidiary that is a commercial bank, savings bank, or savings association, should report the covered loan as purchased by a commercial bank, savings bank, or savings association. A financial institution that sells a covered loan to its subsidiary that is a life insurance company, should report the covered loan as purchased by a life insurance company. A financial institution that sells a covered loan to its subsidiary that is a credit union, mortgage company, or finance company, should report the covered loan as purchased by a credit union, mortgage company, or finance company. If the subsidiary that purchases the covered loan is not a commercial bank, savings bank, savings association, life insurance company, credit union, mortgage company, or finance company, the seller institution should report the loan as purchased by other type of purchaser. The financial institution should report the covered loan as purchased by an affiliate institution when the subsidiary is an affiliate of the seller institution.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-11-Interp-7" id="4-a-11-Interp-7">7. <strong>Type of purchaser - bank holding company or thrift holding company.</strong> When a financial institution sells a covered loan to a bank holding company or thrift holding company (rather than to one of its subsidiaries), it should report the loan as purchased by other type of purchaser, unless the bank holding company or thrift holding company is an affiliate of the seller institution, in which case the seller institution should report the loan as purchased by an affiliate institution.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-11-Interp-8" id="4-a-11-Interp-8">8. <strong>Repurchased covered loans.</strong> See comment 4(a)-5 regarding reporting requirements when a covered loan is repurchased by the originating financial institution.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-11-Interp-9" id="4-a-11-Interp-9">9. <strong>Type of purchaser - quarterly recording.</strong> For purposes of recording the type of purchaser within 30 calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter pursuant to §&#160;1003.4(f), a financial institution records that the requirement is not applicable if the institution originated or purchased a covered loan and did not sell it during the calendar quarter for which the institution is recording the data. If the financial institution sells the covered loan in a subsequent quarter of the same calendar year, the financial institution records the type of purchaser on its loan/application register for the quarter in which the covered loan was sold. If a financial institution sells the covered loan in a succeeding year, the financial institution should not record the sale.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-11-Interp-10" id="4-a-11-Interp-10">10. <strong>Type of purchaser - not applicable.</strong> A financial institution reports that the requirement is not applicable for applications that were denied, withdrawn, closed for incompleteness or approved but not accepted by the applicant; and for preapproval requests that were denied or approved but not accepted by the applicant. A financial institution also reports that the requirement is not applicable if the institution originated or purchased a covered loan and did not sell it during that same calendar year.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-1" id="4-a-12-Interp-1">1. <strong>Average prime offer rate.</strong> Average prime offer rates are annual percentage rates derived from average interest rates and other loan pricing terms offered to borrowers by a set of creditors for mortgage loans that have low-risk pricing characteristics. Other loan pricing terms may include commonly used indices, margins, and initial fixed-rate periods for variable-rate transactions. Relevant pricing characteristics may include a consumer's credit history and transaction characteristics such as the loan-to-value ratio, owner-occupant status, and purpose of the transaction. To obtain average prime offer rates, the Bureau uses creditor data by transaction type.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-2" id="4-a-12-Interp-2">2. <strong>Bureau tables.</strong> The Bureau publishes tables of current and historic average prime offer rates by transaction type on the FFIEC's Web site (<em>http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda</em>) and the Bureau's Web site (<em>https://www.consumerfinance.gov</em>). The Bureau calculates an annual percentage rate, consistent with Regulation Z (<em>see</em> 12 CFR 1026.22 and 12 CFR part 1026, appendix J), for each transaction type for which pricing terms are available from the creditor data described in comment 4(a)(12)-1. The Bureau uses loan pricing terms available in the creditor data and other information to estimate annual percentage rates for other types of transactions for which the creditor data are limited or not available. The Bureau publishes on the FFIEC's Web site and the Bureau's Web site the methodology it uses to arrive at these estimates. A financial institution may either use the average prime offer rates published by the Bureau or determine average prime offer rates itself by employing the methodology published on the FFIEC's Web site and the Bureau's Web site. A financial institution that determines average prime offer rates itself, however, is responsible for correctly determining the rates in accordance with the published methodology.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-3" id="4-a-12-Interp-3">3. <strong>Rate spread calculation - annual percentage rate.</strong> The requirements of §&#160;1003.4(a)(12)(i) refer to the covered loan's annual percentage rate. For closed-end mortgage loans, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(12)(i) by relying on the annual percentage rate for the covered loan, as calculated and disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.18 or 1026.38. For open-end lines of credit, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(12)(i) by relying on the annual percentage rate for the covered loan, as calculated and disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.6. If multiple annual percentage rates are calculated and disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.6, a financial institution relies on the annual percentage rate in effect at the time of account opening. If an open-end line of credit has a variable-rate feature and a fixed-rate and -term payment option during the draw period, a financial institution relies on the annual percentage rate in effect at the time of account opening under the variable-rate feature, which would be a discounted initial rate if one is offered under the variable-rate feature. See comment 4(a)(12)-8 for guidance regarding the annual percentage rate a financial institution relies on in the case of an application or preapproval request that was approved but not accepted.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-4" id="4-a-12-Interp-4">4. <strong>Rate spread calculation - comparable transaction.</strong> The rate spread calculation in §&#160;1003.4(a)(12)(i) is defined by reference to a comparable transaction, which is determined according to the covered loan's amortization type (<em>i.e.,</em> fixed- or variable-rate) and loan term. For covered loans that are open-end lines of credit, §&#160;1003.4(a)(12)(i) requires a financial institution to identify the most closely comparable closed-end transaction. The tables of average prime offer rates published by the Bureau (see comment 4(a)(12)-2) provide additional detail about how to identify the comparable transaction.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-4-i" id="4-a-12-Interp-4-i">i. <strong>Fixed-rate transactions.</strong> For fixed-rate covered loans, the term for identifying the comparable transaction is the transaction's maturity (<em>i.e.,</em> the period until the last payment will be due under the closed-end mortgage loan contract or open-end line of credit agreement). If an open-end credit plan has a fixed rate but no definite plan length, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(12)(i) by using a 30-year fixed-rate loan as the most closely comparable closed-end transaction. Financial institutions may refer to the table on the FFIEC Web site entitled “Average Prime Offer Rates-Fixed” when identifying a comparable fixed-rate transaction.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-4-ii" id="4-a-12-Interp-4-ii">ii. <strong>Variable-rate transactions.</strong> For variable-rate covered loans, the term for identifying the comparable transaction is the initial, fixed-rate period (<em>i.e.,</em> the period until the first scheduled rate adjustment). For example, five years is the relevant term for a variable-rate transaction with a five-year, fixed-rate introductory period that is amortized over thirty years. Financial institutions may refer to the table on the FFIEC Web site entitled “Average Prime Offer Rates-Variable” when identifying a comparable variable-rate transaction. If an open-end line of credit has a variable rate and an optional, fixed-rate feature, a financial institution uses the rate table for variable-rate transactions.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-4-iii" id="4-a-12-Interp-4-iii">iii. <strong>Term not in whole years.</strong> When a covered loan's term to maturity (or, for a variable-rate transaction, the initial fixed-rate period) is not in whole years, the financial institution uses the number of whole years closest to the actual loan term or, if the actual loan term is exactly halfway between two whole years, by using the shorter loan term. For example, for a loan term of ten years and three months, the relevant term is ten years; for a loan term of ten years and nine months, the relevant term is 11 years; for a loan term of ten years and six months, the relevant term is ten years. If a loan term includes an odd number of days, in addition to an odd number of months, the financial institution rounds to the nearest whole month, or rounds down if the number of odd days is exactly halfway between two months. The financial institution rounds to one year any covered loan with a term shorter than six months, including variable-rate covered loans with no initial, fixed-rate periods. For example, if an open-end covered loan has a rate that varies according to an index plus a margin, with no introductory, fixed-rate period, the transaction term is one year.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-4-iv" id="4-a-12-Interp-4-iv">iv. <strong>Amortization period longer than loan term.</strong> If the amortization period of a covered loan is longer than the term of the transaction to maturity, §&#160;1003.4(a)(12)(i) requires a financial institution to use the loan term to determine the applicable average prime offer rate. For example, assume a financial institution originates a closed-end, fixed-rate loan that has a term to maturity of five years and a thirty-year amortization period that results in a balloon payment. The financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(12)(i) by using the five-year loan term.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-5" id="4-a-12-Interp-5">5. <strong>Rate-set date.</strong> The relevant date to use to determine the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction is the date on which the interest rate was set by the financial institution for the final time before final action is taken (<em>i.e.,</em> the application was approved but not accepted or the covered loan was originated).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-5-i" id="4-a-12-Interp-5-i">i. <strong>Rate-lock agreement.</strong> If an interest rate is set pursuant to a “lock-in” agreement between the financial institution and the borrower, then the date on which the agreement fixes the interest rate is the date the rate was set. Except as provided in comment 4(a)(12)-5.ii, if a rate is reset after a lock-in agreement is executed (for example, because the borrower exercises a float-down option or the agreement expires), then the relevant date is the date the financial institution exercises discretion in setting the rate for the final time before final action is taken. The same rule applies when a rate-lock agreement is extended and the rate is reset at the same rate, regardless of whether market rates have increased, decreased, or remained the same since the initial rate was set. If no lock-in agreement is executed, then the relevant date is the date on which the institution sets the rate for the final time before final action is taken.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-5-ii" id="4-a-12-Interp-5-ii">ii. <strong>Change in loan program.</strong> If a financial institution issues a rate-lock commitment under one loan program, the borrower subsequently changes to another program that is subject to different pricing terms, and the financial institution changes the rate promised to the borrower under the rate-lock commitment accordingly, the rate-set date is the date of the program change. However, if the financial institution changes the promised rate to the rate that would have been available to the borrower under the new program on the date of the original rate-lock commitment, then that is the date the rate is set, provided the financial institution consistently follows that practice in all such cases or the original rate-lock agreement so provided. For example, assume that a borrower locks a rate of 2.5 percent on June 1 for a 30-year, variable-rate loan with a five-year, fixed-rate introductory period. On June 15, the borrower decides to switch to a 30-year, fixed-rate loan, and the rate available to the borrower for that product on June 15 is 4.0 percent. On June 1, the 30-year, fixed-rate loan would have been available to the borrower at a rate of 3.5 percent. If the financial institution offers the borrower the 3.5 percent rate (<em>i.e.,</em> the rate that would have been available to the borrower for the fixed-rate product on June 1, the date of the original rate-lock) because the original agreement so provided or because the financial institution consistently follows that practice for borrowers who change loan programs, then the financial institution should use June 1 as the rate-set date. In all other cases, the financial institution should use June 15 as the rate-set date.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-5-iii" id="4-a-12-Interp-5-iii">iii. <strong>Brokered loans.</strong> When a financial institution has reporting responsibility for an application for a covered loan that it received from a broker, as discussed in comment 4(a)-2 (<em>e.g.,</em> because the financial institution makes a credit decision prior to closing or account opening), the rate-set date is the last date the financial institution set the rate with the broker, not the date the broker set the borrower's rate.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-6" id="4-a-12-Interp-6">6. <strong>Compare the annual percentage rate to the average prime offer rate.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(12)(i) requires a financial institution to compare the covered loan's annual percentage rate to the most recently available average prime offer rate that was in effect for the comparable transaction as of the rate-set date. For purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(12)(i), the most recently available rate means the average prime offer rate set forth in the applicable table with the most recent effective date as of the date the interest rate was set. However, §&#160;1003.4(a)(12)(i) does not permit a financial institution to use an average prime offer rate before its effective date.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-7" id="4-a-12-Interp-7">7. <strong>Rate spread - scope of requirement.</strong> If the covered loan is an assumption, reverse mortgage, a purchased loan, or is not subject to Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(12) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable. If the application did not result in an origination for a reason other than the application was approved but not accepted by the applicant, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(12) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable. For partially exempt transactions under §&#160;1003.3(d), an insured depository institution or insured credit union is not required to report the rate spread. See §&#160;1003.3(d) and related commentary.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-8" id="4-a-12-Interp-8">8. <strong>Application or preapproval request approved but not accepted.</strong> In the case of an application or preapproval request that was approved but not accepted, §&#160;1003.4(a)(12) requires a financial institution to report the applicable rate spread. In such cases, the financial institution would provide early disclosures under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.18 or 1026.37 (for closed-end mortgage loans), or 1026.40 (for open-end lines of credit), but might never provide any subsequent disclosures. In such cases where no subsequent disclosures are provided, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(12)(i) by relying on the annual percentage rate for the application or preapproval request, as calculated and disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.18 or 1026.37 (for closed-end mortgage loans), or 1026.40 (for open-end lines of credit), as applicable. For transactions subject to Regulation C for which no disclosures under Regulation Z are required, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(12)(i) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-12-Interp-9" id="4-a-12-Interp-9">9. <strong>Corrected disclosures.</strong> In the case of a covered loan or an application that was approved but not accepted, if the annual percentage rate changes because a financial institution provides a corrected version of the disclosures required under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(a), pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(a)(2), under 12 CFR 1026.19(f), pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(f)(2), or under 12 CFR 1026.6(a), the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(12)(i) by comparing the corrected and disclosed annual percentage rate to the most recently available average prime offer rate that was in effect for a comparable transaction as of the rate-set date, provided that the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior to the end of the reporting period in which final action is taken. For purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(12), the date the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower is the date the disclosure was mailed or delivered to the borrower in person; the financial institution's method of delivery does not affect the date provided. For example, where a financial institution provides a corrected version of the disclosures required under 12 CFR 1026.19(f), pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(f)(2), the date provided is the date disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.38(a)(3)(i). The provision of a corrected disclosure does not affect how a financial institution determines the rate-set date. <em>See</em> comment 4(a)(12)-5. For example, in the case of a financial institution's annual loan/application register submission made pursuant to §&#160;1003.5(a)(1), if the financial institution provides a corrected disclosure to the borrower pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(f)(2)(v), that reflects a corrected annual percentage rate, the financial institution reports the difference between the corrected annual percentage rate and the most recently available average prime offer rate that was in effect for a comparable transaction as of the rate-set date if the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior to the end of the calendar year in which final action is taken.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-14-Interp-1" id="4-a-14-Interp-1">1. <strong>Determining lien status for applications and covered loans originated and purchased.</strong> i. Financial institutions are required to report lien status for covered loans they originate and purchase and applications that do not result in originations (preapproval requests that are approved but not accepted, preapproval requests that are denied, applications that are approved but not accepted, denied, withdrawn, or closed for incompleteness). For covered loans purchased by a financial institution, lien status is determined by reference to the best information readily available to the financial institution at the time of purchase. For covered loans that a financial institution originates and applications that do not result in originations, lien status is determined by reference to the best information readily available to the financial institution at the time final action is taken and to the financial institution's own procedures. Thus, financial institutions may rely on the title search they routinely perform as part of their underwriting procedures - for example, for home purchase loans. Regulation C does not require financial institutions to perform title searches solely to comply with HMDA reporting requirements. Financial institutions may rely on other information that is readily available to them at the time final action is taken and that they reasonably believe is accurate, such as the applicant's statement on the application or the applicant's credit report. For example, where the applicant indicates on the application that there is a mortgage on the property or where the applicant's credit report shows that the applicant has a mortgage - and that mortgage will not be paid off as part of the transaction - the financial institution may assume that the loan it originates is secured by a subordinate lien. If the same application did not result in an origination - for example, because the application was denied or withdrawn - the financial institution would report the application as an application for a subordinate-lien loan.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-14-Interp-ii" id="4-a-14-Interp-ii">ii. Financial institutions may also consider their established procedures when determining lien status for applications that do not result in originations. For example, assume an applicant applies to a financial institution to refinance a $100,000 first mortgage; the applicant also has an open-end line of credit for $20,000. If the financial institution's practice in such a case is to ensure that it will have first-lien position - through a subordination agreement with the holder of the lien securing the open-end line of credit - then the financial institution should report the application as an application for a first-lien covered loan.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-15-Interp-1" id="4-a-15-Interp-1">1. <strong>Credit score - relied on.</strong> Except for purchased covered loans and partially exempt transactions under §&#160;1003.3(d), §&#160;1003.4(a)(15) requires a financial institution to report the credit score or scores relied on in making the credit decision and information about the scoring model used to generate each score. A financial institution relies on a credit score in making the credit decision if the credit score was a factor in the credit decision even if it was not a dispositive factor. For example, if a credit score is one of multiple factors in a financial institution's credit decision, the financial institution has relied on the credit score even if the financial institution denies the application because one or more underwriting requirements other than the credit score are not satisfied.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-15-Interp-2" id="4-a-15-Interp-2">2. <strong>Credit score - multiple credit scores.</strong> When a financial institution obtains or creates two or more credit scores for a single applicant or borrower but relies on only one score in making the credit decision (for example, by relying on the lowest, highest, most recent, or average of all of the scores), the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(15) by reporting that credit score and information about the scoring model used. When a financial institution uses more than one credit scoring model and combines the scores into a composite credit score that it relies on, the financial institution reports that score and reports that more than one credit scoring model was used. When a financial institution obtains or creates two or more credit scores for an applicant or borrower and relies on multiple scores for the applicant or borrower in making the credit decision (for example, by relying on a scoring grid that considers each of the scores obtained or created for the applicant or borrower without combining the scores into a composite score), §&#160;1003.4(a)(15) requires the financial institution to report one of the credit scores for the applicant or borrower that was relied on in making the credit decision. In choosing which credit score to report in this circumstance, a financial institution need not use the same approach for its entire HMDA submission, but it should be generally consistent (such as by routinely using one approach within a particular division of the institution or for a category of covered loans). In instances such as these, the financial institution should report the name and version of the credit scoring model for the score reported.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-15-Interp-3" id="4-a-15-Interp-3">3. <strong>Credit score - multiple applicants or borrowers.</strong> In a transaction involving two or more applicants or borrowers for whom the financial institution obtains or creates a single credit score and relies on that credit score in making the credit decision for the transaction, the institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(15) by reporting that credit score for the applicant and reporting that the requirement is not applicable for the first co-applicant or, at the financial institution's discretion, by reporting that credit score for the first co-applicant and reporting that the requirement is not applicable for the applicant. Otherwise, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(15) by reporting a credit score for the applicant that it relied on in making the credit decision, if any, and a credit score for the first co-applicant that it relied on in making the credit decision, if any. To illustrate, assume a transaction involves one applicant and one co-applicant and that the financial institution obtains or creates two credit scores for the applicant and two credit scores for the co-applicant. Assume further that the financial institution relies on a single credit score that is the lowest, highest, most recent, or average of all of the credit scores obtained or created to make the credit decision for the transaction. The financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(15) by reporting that credit score and information about the scoring model used for the applicant and reporting that the requirement is not applicable for the first co-applicant or, at the financial institution's discretion, by reporting the data for the first co-applicant and reporting that the requirement is not applicable for the applicant. Alternatively, assume a transaction involves one applicant and one co-applicant and that the financial institution obtains or creates three credit scores for the applicant and three credit scores for the co-applicant. Assume further that the financial institution relies on the middle credit score for the applicant and the middle credit score for the co-applicant to make the credit decision for the transaction. The financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(15) by reporting both the middle score for the applicant and the middle score for the co-applicant.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-15-Interp-4" id="4-a-15-Interp-4">4. <strong>Transactions for which no credit decision was made.</strong> If a file was closed for incompleteness or the application was withdrawn before a credit decision was made, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(15) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had obtained or created a credit score for the applicant or co-applicant. For example, if a file is closed for incompleteness and is so reported in accordance with §&#160;1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(15) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had obtained or created a credit score for the applicant or co-applicant. Similarly, if an application was withdrawn by the applicant before a credit decision was made and is so reported in accordance with §&#160;1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(15) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had obtained or created a credit score for the applicant or co-applicant.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-15-Interp-5" id="4-a-15-Interp-5">5. <strong>Transactions for which no credit score was relied on.</strong> If a financial institution makes a credit decision without relying on a credit score for the applicant or borrower, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(15) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</p>

The financial institution should report only the principal reason or reasons it denied the application, even if there are fewer than four reasons. For example, if a financial institution denies the application because of the applicant's credit history and debt-to-income ratio, the financial institution need only report these two principal reasons. The reasons reported must be specific and accurately describe the principal reason or reasons the financial institution denied the application.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-16-Interp-2" id="4-a-16-Interp-2">2. <strong>Reason for denial - preapproval request denied.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(16) requires a financial institution to report the principal reason or reasons it denied the application. A request for a preapproval under a preapproval program as defined by §&#160;1003.2(b)(2) is an application. If a financial institution denies a preapproval request, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(16) by reporting the reason or reasons it denied the preapproval request.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-16-Interp-3" id="4-a-16-Interp-3">3. <strong>Reason for denial - adverse action model form or similar form.</strong> If a financial institution chooses to provide the applicant the reason or reasons it denied the application using the model form contained in appendix C to Regulation B (Form C-1, Sample Notice of Action Taken and Statement of Reasons) or a similar form, §&#160;1003.4(a)(16) requires the financial institution to report the reason or reasons that were specified on the form by the financial institution, which includes reporting the “Other” reason or reasons that were specified on the form by the financial institution, if applicable. If a financial institution chooses to provide a disclosure of the applicant's right to a statement of specific reasons using the model form contained in appendix C to Regulation B (Form C-5, Sample Disclosure of Right to Request Specific Reasons for Credit Denial) or a similar form, or chooses to provide the denial reason or reasons orally under Regulation B, 12 CFR 1002.9(a)(2)(ii), the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(16) by entering the principal reason or reasons it denied the application.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-16-Interp-4" id="4-a-16-Interp-4">4. <strong>Reason for denial - scope of requirement.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(16) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable if the action taken on the application, pursuant to §&#160;1003.4(a)(8), is not a denial. For example, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(16) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable if the loan is originated or purchased by the financial institution, or the application or preapproval request was approved but not accepted, or the application was withdrawn before a credit decision was made, or the file was closed for incompleteness. For partially exempt transactions under §&#160;1003.3(d), an insured depository institution or insured credit union is not required to report the principal reason or reasons it denied an application.

For example, in the case of a financial institution's quarterly submission, the financial institution reports the revised amount of total points and fees only if it cured the overage prior to the end of the quarter in which closing occurred. The financial institution does not report the revised amount of total points and fees in its quarterly submission if it cured the overage after the end of the quarter, even if the cure was effected prior to the deadline for timely submission of the financial institution's quarterly data.

In these cases, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(20) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable to the transaction. For partially exempt transactions under §&#160;1003.3(d), an insured depository institution or insured credit union is not required to report lender credits. See §&#160;1003.3(d) and related commentary.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-20-Interp-2" id="4-a-20-Interp-2">2. <strong>Purchased loans - applications received prior to the integrated disclosure effective date.</strong> For purchased covered loans subject to this reporting requirement for which applications were received by the selling entity prior to the effective date of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(f), a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(20) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable to the transaction.</p>

For purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(20), the date the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower is the date disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.38(a)(3)(i). For example, in the case of a financial institution's annual loan/application register submission made pursuant to §&#160;1003.5(a)(1), if the financial institution provides a corrected disclosure to the borrower to reflect a refund made pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(f)(2)(v), the financial institution reports the corrected amount of lender credits only if the corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior to the end of the calendar year in which closing occurs.</p>

For covered loans or applications subject to the integrated mortgage disclosure requirements of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(e) and (f), a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(21) by reporting the interest rate disclosed on the applicable disclosure. For covered loans or approved applications for which disclosures were provided pursuant to both the early and the final disclosure requirements in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(e) and (f), a financial institution reports the interest rate disclosed pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(f). A financial institution may rely on the definitions and commentary to the sections of Regulation Z relevant to the disclosure of the interest rate pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(e) or (f). If a financial institution provides a revised or corrected version of the disclosures required under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.19(e) or (f), pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(e)(3)(iv) or (f)(2), as applicable, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(21) by reporting the interest rate on the revised or corrected disclosure, provided that the revised or corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower prior to the end of the reporting period in which final action is taken. For purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(21), the date the revised or corrected disclosure was provided to the borrower is the date disclosed pursuant to Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.37(a)(4) or 1026.38(a)(3)(i), as applicable.</p>

In such cases, a financial institution reports the interest rate applicable at the time that the application was approved by the financial institution. A financial institution may report the interest rate appearing on the disclosure provided pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.19(e) or (f) if such disclosure accurately reflects the interest rate at the time the application was approved. For applications that have been denied or withdrawn, or files closed for incompleteness, a financial institution reports that no interest rate was applicable to the application.</p>

For purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(21), the fully-indexed rate is the index value and margin at the time that the application was approved, or, for covered loans, at closing or account opening.</p>

For example, if a financial institution calculated the applicant's or borrower's debt-to-income ratio twice - once according to the financial institution's own requirements and once according to the requirements of a secondary market investor - and the financial institution relied on the debt-to-income ratio calculated according to the secondary market investor's requirements in making the credit decision, §&#160;1003.4(a)(23) requires the financial institution to report the debt-to-income ratio calculated according to the requirements of the secondary market investor.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-23-Interp-2" id="4-a-23-Interp-2">2. <strong>Transactions for which a debt-to-income ratio was one of multiple factors.</strong> A financial institution relies on the ratio of the applicant's or borrower's total monthly debt to total monthly income (debt-to-income ratio) in making the credit decision if the debt-to-income ratio was a factor in the credit decision even if it was not a dispositive factor. For example, if the debt-to-income ratio was one of multiple factors in a financial institution's credit decision, the financial institution has relied on the debt-to-income ratio and complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(23) by reporting the debt-to-income ratio, even if the financial institution denied the application because one or more underwriting requirements other than the debt-to-income ratio were not satisfied.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-23-Interp-3" id="4-a-23-Interp-3">3. <strong>Transactions for which no credit decision was made.</strong> If a file was closed for incompleteness, or if an application was withdrawn before a credit decision was made, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(23) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had calculated the ratio of the applicant's total monthly debt to total monthly income (debt-to-income ratio). For example, if a file was closed for incompleteness and was so reported in accordance with §&#160;1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(23) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had calculated the applicant's debt-to-income ratio. Similarly, if an application was withdrawn by the applicant before a credit decision was made, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(23) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had calculated the applicant's debt-to-income ratio.</p>

If a financial institution made a credit decision without relying on the applicant's or borrower's debt-to-income ratio, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(23) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable since no debt-to-income ratio was relied on in connection with the credit decision.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-24-Interp-1" id="4-a-24-Interp-1">1. <strong>General.</strong> Except for purchased covered loans and partially exempt transactions under §&#160;1003.3(d), §&#160;1003.4(a)(24) requires a financial institution to report the ratio of the total amount of debt secured by the property to the value of the property (combined loan-to-value ratio) relied on in making the credit decision. For example, if a financial institution calculated a combined loan-to-value ratio twice - once according to the financial institution's own requirements and once according to the requirements of a secondary market investor - and the financial institution relied on the combined loan-to-value ratio calculated according to the secondary market investor's requirements in making the credit decision, §&#160;1003.4(a)(24) requires the financial institution to report the combined loan-to-value ratio calculated according to the requirements of the secondary market investor.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-24-Interp-2" id="4-a-24-Interp-2">2. <strong>Transactions for which a combined loan-to-value ratio was one of multiple factors.</strong> A financial institution relies on the ratio of the total amount of debt secured by the property to the value of the property (combined loan-to-value ratio) in making the credit decision if the combined loan-to-value ratio was a factor in the credit decision, even if it was not a dispositive factor. For example, if the combined loan-to-value ratio is one of multiple factors in a financial institution's credit decision, the financial institution has relied on the combined loan-to-value ratio and complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(24) by reporting the combined loan-to-value ratio, even if the financial institution denies the application because one or more underwriting requirements other than the combined loan-to-value ratio are not satisfied.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-24-Interp-3" id="4-a-24-Interp-3">3. <strong>Transactions for which no credit decision was made.</strong> If a file was closed for incompleteness, or if an application was withdrawn before a credit decision was made, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(24) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had calculated the ratio of the total amount of debt secured by the property to the value of the property (combined loan-to-value ratio). For example, if a file is closed for incompleteness and is so reported in accordance with §&#160;1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(24) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had calculated a combined loan-to-value ratio. Similarly, if an application was withdrawn by the applicant before a credit decision was made and is so reported in accordance with §&#160;1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(24) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had calculated a combined loan-to-value ratio.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-24-Interp-4" id="4-a-24-Interp-4">4. <strong>Transactions for which no combined loan-to-value ratio was relied on.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(24) does not require a financial institution to calculate the ratio of the total amount of debt secured by the property to the value of the property (combined loan-to-value ratio), nor does it require a financial institution to rely on a combined loan-to-value ratio in making a credit decision. If a financial institution makes a credit decision without relying on a combined loan-to-value ratio, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(24) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable since no combined loan-to-value ratio was relied on in making the credit decision.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-24-Interp-5" id="4-a-24-Interp-5">5. <strong>Purchased covered loan.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(24) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable when the covered loan is a purchased covered loan.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-24-Interp-6" id="4-a-24-Interp-6">6. <strong>Property.</strong> A financial institution reports the combined loan-to-value ratio relied on in making the credit decision, regardless of which property or properties it used in the combined loan-to-value ratio calculation. The property used in the combined loan-to-value ratio calculation does not need to be the property identified in §&#160;1003.4(a)(9) and may include more than one property and non-real property. For example, if a financial institution originated a covered loan for the purchase of a multifamily dwelling, the loan was secured by the multifamily dwelling and by non-real property, such as securities, and the financial institution used the multifamily dwelling and the non-real property to calculate the combined loan-to-value ratio that it relied on in making the credit decision, §&#160;1003.4(a)(24) requires the financial institution to report the relied upon ratio. Section 1003.4(a)(24) does not require a financial institution to use a particular combined loan-to-value ratio calculation method but instead requires financial institutions to report the combined loan-to-value ratio relied on in making the credit decision.</p>

Some covered loans do not fully amortize during the maturity term, such as covered loans with a balloon payment; such loans should still be reported using the maturity term rather than the amortization term, even in the case of covered loans that mature before fully amortizing but have reset options. For example, a 30-year fully amortizing covered loan would be reported with a term of “360,” while a five year balloon covered loan would be reported with a loan term of “60.”</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-26-Interp-1" id="4-a-26-Interp-1">1. <strong>Types of introductory rates.</strong> Except for partially exempt transactions under §&#160;1003.3(d), §&#160;1003.4(a)(26) requires a financial institution to report the number of months, or proposed number of months in the case of an application, from closing or account opening until the first date the interest rate may change. For example, assume an open-end line of credit contains an introductory or “teaser” interest rate for two months after the date of account opening, after which the interest rate may adjust. In this example, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(26) by reporting the number of months as “2.” Section 1003.4(a)(26) requires a financial institution to report the number of months based on when the first interest rate adjustment may occur, even if an interest rate adjustment is not required to occur at that time and even if the rates that will apply, or the periods for which they will apply, are not known at closing or account opening. For example, if a closed-end mortgage loan with a 30-year term has an adjustable-rate product with an introductory interest rate for the first 60 months, after which the interest rate is permitted, but not required to vary, according to the terms of an index rate, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(26) by reporting the number of months as “60.” Similarly, if a closed-end mortgage loan with a 30-year term is a step-rate product with an introductory interest rate for the first 24 months, after which the interest rate will increase to a different known interest rate for the next 36 months, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(26) by reporting the number of months as “24.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-26-Interp-2" id="4-a-26-Interp-2">2. <strong>Preferred rates.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(26) does not require reporting of introductory interest rate periods based on preferred rates unless the terms of the legal obligation provide that the preferred rate will expire at a certain defined date. Preferred rates include terms of the legal obligation that provide that the initial underlying rate is fixed but that it may increase or decrease upon the occurrence of some future event, such as an employee leaving the employ of the financial institution, the borrower closing an existing deposit account with the financial institution, or the borrower revoking an election to make automated payments. In these cases, because it is not known at the time of closing or account opening whether the future event will occur, and if so, when it will occur, §&#160;1003.4(a)(26) does not require reporting of an introductory interest rate period.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-26-Interp-3" id="4-a-26-Interp-3">3. <strong>Loan or application with a fixed rate.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(26) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable for a covered loan with a fixed rate or an application for a covered loan with a fixed rate.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-26-Interp-4" id="4-a-26-Interp-4">4. <strong>Purchased loan.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(26) by reporting that requirement is not applicable when the covered loan is a purchased covered loan with a fixed rate.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-26-Interp-5" id="4-a-26-Interp-5">5. <strong>Non-monthly introductory periods.</strong> If a covered loan or application includes an introductory interest rate period measured in a unit of time other than months, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(26) by reporting the introductory interest rate period for the covered loan or application using an equivalent number of whole months without regard for any remainder. For example, assume an open-end line of credit contains an introductory interest rate for 50 days after the date of account opening, after which the interest rate may adjust. In this example, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(26) by reporting the number of months as “1.” The financial institution must report one month for any introductory interest rate period that totals less than one whole month.</p>

Section 1003.4(a)(27) defines the contractual features by reference to Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, but without regard to whether the covered loan is consumer credit, as defined in §&#160;1026.2(a)(12), is extended by a creditor, as defined in §&#160;1026.2(a)(17), or is extended to a consumer, as defined in §&#160;1026.2(a)(11), and without regard to whether the property is a dwelling as defined in §&#160;1026.2(a)(19). For example, assume that a financial institution originates a business-purpose transaction that is exempt from Regulation Z pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.3(a)(1), to finance the purchase of a multifamily dwelling, and that there is a balloon payment, as defined by Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.18(s)(5)(i), at the end of the loan term. The multifamily dwelling is a dwelling under §&#160;1003.2(f), but not under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(19). In this example, the financial institution should report the business-purpose transaction as having a balloon payment under §&#160;1003.4(a)(27)(i), assuming the other requirements of this part are met. Aside from these distinctions, financial institutions may rely on the definitions and related commentary provided in the appropriate sections of Regulation Z referenced in §&#160;1003.4(a)(27) of this part in determining whether the contractual feature should be reported.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-28-Interp-1" id="4-a-28-Interp-1">1. <strong>General.</strong> Except for partially exempt transactions under §&#160;1003.3(d), §&#160;1003.4(a)(28) requires a financial institution to report the property value relied on in making the credit decision. For example, if the institution relies on an appraisal or other valuation for the property in calculating the loan-to-value ratio, it reports that value; if the institution relies on the purchase price of the property in calculating the loan-to-value ratio, it reports that value.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-28-Interp-2" id="4-a-28-Interp-2">2. <strong>Multiple property values.</strong> When a financial institution obtains two or more valuations of the property securing or proposed to secure the covered loan, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(28) by reporting the value relied on in making the credit decision. For example, when a financial institution obtains an appraisal, an automated valuation model report, and a broker price opinion with different values for the property, it reports the value relied on in making the credit decision. Section §&#160;1003.4(a)(28) does not require a financial institution to use a particular property valuation method, but instead requires a financial institution to report the valuation relied on in making the credit decision.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-28-Interp-3" id="4-a-28-Interp-3">3. <strong>Transactions for which no credit decision was made.</strong> If a file was closed for incompleteness or the application was withdrawn before a credit decision was made, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(28) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had obtained a property value. For example, if a file is closed for incompleteness and is so reported in accordance with §&#160;1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(28) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had obtained a property value. Similarly, if an application was withdrawn by the applicant before a credit decision was made and is so reported in accordance with §&#160;1003.4(a)(8), the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(28) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, even if the financial institution had obtained a property value.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-28-Interp-4" id="4-a-28-Interp-4">4. <strong>Transactions for which no property value was relied on.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(28) does not require a financial institution to obtain a property valuation, nor does it require a financial institution to rely on a property value in making a credit decision. If a financial institution makes a credit decision without relying on a property value, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(28) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable since no property value was relied on in making the credit decision.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-30-Interp-1" id="4-a-30-Interp-1">1. <strong>Indirect land ownership.</strong> Indirect land ownership can occur when the applicant or borrower is or will be a member of a resident-owned community structured as a housing cooperative in which the occupants own an entity that holds the underlying land of the manufactured home community. In such communities, the applicant or borrower may still have a lease and pay rent for the lot on which his or her manufactured home is or will be located, but the property interest type for such an arrangement should be reported as indirect ownership if the applicant is or will be a member of the cooperative that owns the underlying land of the manufactured home community. If an applicant resides or will reside in such a community but is not a member, the property interest type should be reported as a paid leasehold.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-30-Interp-2" id="4-a-30-Interp-2">2. <strong>Leasehold interest.</strong> A leasehold interest could be formalized in a lease with a defined term and specified rent payments, or could arise as a tenancy at will through permission of a land owner without any written, formal arrangement. For example, assume a borrower will locate the manufactured home in a manufactured home community, has a written lease for a lot in that park, and the lease specifies rent payments. In this example, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(30) by reporting a paid leasehold. However, if instead the borrower will locate the manufactured home on land owned by a family member without a written lease and with no agreement as to rent payments, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(30) by reporting an unpaid leasehold.</p>

A financial institution may include in the number of individual dwelling units other units such as recreational vehicle pads, manager apartments, rental apartments, site-built homes or other rentable space that are ancillary to the operation of the secured property if it considers such units under its underwriting guidelines or the guidelines of an investor, or if it tracks the number of such units for its own internal purposes.

Such income levels are frequently expressed as a percentage of area median income by household size as established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or another agency responsible for implementing the applicable affordable housing program. Such restrictions are frequently part of compliance with programs that provide public funds, special tax treatment, or density bonuses to encourage development or preservation of affordable housing. Such restrictions are frequently evidenced by a use agreement, regulatory agreement, land use restriction agreement, housing assistance payments contract, or similar agreement. Rent control or rent stabilization laws, and the acceptance by the owner or manager of a multifamily dwelling of Housing Choice Vouchers (24 CFR part 982) or other similar forms of portable housing assistance that are tied to an occupant and not an individual dwelling unit, are not affordable housing income-restricted dwelling units for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(32).</p>

Information readily available could include, for example, information provided by an applicant that the financial institution reasonably believes, information contained in a property valuation or inspection, or information obtained from public records.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-32-Interp-6" id="4-a-32-Interp-6">6. <strong>Scope of requirement.</strong> A financial institution reports that the requirement is not applicable if the property securing the covered loan or, in the case of an application, proposed to secure the covered loan is not a multifamily dwelling. For partially exempt transactions under §&#160;1003.3(d), an insured depository institution or insured credit union is not required to report the information specified in §&#160;1003.4(a)(32).

For more information, see the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, title V of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (S.A.F.E. Act), 12 U.S.C. 5101 <em>et seq.,</em> and its implementing regulations (12 CFR part 1007 and 12 CFR part 1008).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-34-Interp-2" id="4-a-34-Interp-2">2. <strong>Mortgage loan originator without NMLSR ID.</strong> An NMLSR ID for the mortgage loan originator is not required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(34) to be reported by a financial institution if the mortgage loan originator is not required to obtain and has not been assigned an NMLSR ID. For example, certain individual mortgage loan originators may not be required to obtain an NMLSR ID for the particular transaction being reported by the financial institution, such as a commercial loan. However, some mortgage loan originators may have obtained an NMLSR ID even if they are not required to obtain one for that particular transaction. If a mortgage loan originator has been assigned an NMLSR ID, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(34) by reporting the mortgage loan originator's NMLSR ID regardless of whether the mortgage loan originator is required to obtain an NMLSR ID for the particular transaction being reported by the financial institution. In the event that the mortgage loan originator is not required to obtain and has not been assigned an NMLSR ID, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(34) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-34-Interp-3" id="4-a-34-Interp-3">3. <strong>Multiple mortgage loan originators.</strong> If more than one individual associated with a covered loan or application meets the definition of a mortgage loan originator, as defined in Regulation G, 12 CFR 1007.102, or Regulation H, 12 CFR 1008.23, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(34) by reporting the NMLSR ID of the individual mortgage loan originator with primary responsibility for the transaction as of the date of action taken pursuant to §&#160;1003.4(a)(8)(ii). A financial institution that establishes and follows a reasonable, written policy for determining which individual mortgage loan originator has primary responsibility for the reported transaction as of the date of action taken complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(34).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-34-Interp-4" id="4-a-34-Interp-4">4. <strong>Purchased loans.</strong> If a financial institution purchases a covered loan that satisfies the coverage criteria of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.36(g), and that was originated prior to January 10, 2014, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(34) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable. In addition, if a financial institution purchases a covered loan that does not satisfy the coverage criteria of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.36(g), and that was originated prior to January 1, 2018, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(34) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable. Purchasers of both such types of covered loans may report the NMLSR ID.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-1-i" id="4-a-35-Interp-1-i">i. A financial institution that uses an AUS, as defined in §&#160;1003.4(a)(35)(ii), to evaluate an application, must report the name of the AUS used by the financial institution to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system, regardless of whether the AUS was used in its underwriting process. For example, if a financial institution uses an AUS to evaluate an application prior to submitting the application through its underwriting process, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of the AUS it used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-1-ii" id="4-a-35-Interp-1-ii">ii. A financial institution that uses an AUS, as defined in §&#160;1003.4(a)(35)(ii), to evaluate an application, must report the name of the AUS it used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system, regardless of whether the financial institution intends to hold the covered loan in its portfolio or sell the covered loan. For example, if a financial institution uses an AUS developed by a securitizer to evaluate an application and intends to sell the covered loan to that securitizer but ultimately does not sell the covered loan and instead holds the covered loan in its portfolio, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of the securitizer's AUS that the institution used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system. Similarly, if a financial institution uses an AUS developed by a securitizer to evaluate an application to determine whether to originate the covered loan but does not intend to sell the covered loan to that securitizer and instead holds the covered loan in its portfolio, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of the securitizer's AUS that the institution used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-1-iii" id="4-a-35-Interp-1-iii">iii. A financial institution that uses an AUS, as defined in §&#160;1003.4(a)(35)(ii), that is developed by a securitizer to evaluate an application, must report the name of the AUS it used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system, regardless of whether the securitizer intends to hold the covered loan it purchased from the financial institution in its portfolio or securitize the covered loan. For example, if a financial institution uses an AUS developed by a securitizer to evaluate an application and the financial institution sells the covered loan to that securitizer but the securitizer holds the covered loan it purchased in its portfolio, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of the securitizer's AUS that the institution used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-1-iv" id="4-a-35-Interp-1-iv">iv. A financial institution, which is also a securitizer, that uses its own AUS, as defined in §&#160;1003.4(a)(35)(ii), to evaluate an application, must report the name of the AUS it used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system, regardless of whether the financial institution intends to hold the covered loan it originates in its portfolio, purchase the covered loan, or securitize the covered loan. For example, if a financial institution, which is also a securitizer, has developed its own AUS and uses that AUS to evaluate an application that it intends to originate and hold in its portfolio and not purchase or securitize the covered loan, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of its AUS that it used to evaluate the application and the result generated by that system.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-2" id="4-a-35-Interp-2">2. <strong>Definition of automated underwriting system.</strong> A financial institution must report the information required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(35)(i) if the financial institution uses an automated underwriting system (AUS), as defined in §&#160;1003.4(a)(35)(ii), to evaluate an application. To be covered by the definition in §&#160;1003.4(a)(35)(ii), a system must be an electronic tool that has been developed by a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or a Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit. A person is a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, respectively, if it has securitized, provided Federal government insurance, or provided a Federal government guarantee for a closed-end mortgage loan or open-end line of credit at any point in time. A person may be a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, respectively, for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) even if it is not actively securitizing, insuring, or guaranteeing closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit at the time a financial institution uses the AUS to evaluate an application. Where the person that developed the electronic tool has never been a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, respectively, at the time a financial institution uses the tool to evaluate an application, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable because an AUS was not used to evaluate the application. If a financial institution has developed its own proprietary system that it uses to evaluate an application and the financial institution is also a securitizer, then the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of that system and the result generated by that system. On the other hand, if a financial institution has developed its own proprietary system that it uses to evaluate an application and the financial institution is not a securitizer, then the financial institution is not required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) to report the use of that system and the result generated by that system. In addition, for an AUS to be covered by the definition in §&#160;1003.4(a)(35)(ii), the system must provide a result regarding both the credit risk of the applicant and the eligibility of the covered loan to be originated, purchased, insured, or guaranteed by the securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor that developed the system being used to evaluate the application. For example, if a system is an electronic tool that provides a determination of the eligibility of the covered loan to be originated, purchased, insured, or guaranteed by the securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor that developed the system being used by a financial institution to evaluate the application, but the system does not also provide an assessment of the creditworthiness of the applicant - such as an evaluation of the applicant's income, debt, and credit history - then that system does not qualify as an AUS, as defined in §&#160;1003.4(a)(35)(ii). A financial institution that uses a system that is not an AUS, as defined in §&#160;1003.4(a)(35)(ii), to evaluate an application does not report the information required by §&#160;1003.4(a)(35)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-3" id="4-a-35-Interp-3">3. <strong>Reporting automated underwriting system data - multiple results.</strong> When a financial institution uses one or more automated underwriting systems (AUS) to evaluate the application and the system or systems generate two or more results, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting, except for purchased covered loans, the name of the AUS used by the financial institution to evaluate the application and the result generated by that AUS as determined by the following principles. To determine what AUS (or AUSs) and result (or results) to report under §&#160;1003.4(a)(35), a financial institution follows each of the principles that is applicable to the application in question, in the order in which they are set forth below.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-3-i" id="4-a-35-Interp-3-i">i. If a financial institution obtains two or more AUS results and the AUS generating one of those results corresponds to the loan type reported pursuant to §&#160;1003.4(a)(2), the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that AUS name and result. For example, if a financial institution evaluates an application using the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) Technology Open to Approved Lenders (TOTAL) Scorecard and subsequently evaluates the application with an AUS used to determine eligibility for a non-FHA loan, but ultimately originates an FHA loan, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting TOTAL Scorecard and the result generated by that system. If a financial institution obtains two or more AUS results and more than one of those AUS results is generated by a system that corresponds to the loan type reported pursuant to §&#160;1003.4(a)(2), the financial institution identifies which AUS result should be reported by following the principle set forth below in comment 4(a)(35)-3.ii.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-3-ii" id="4-a-35-Interp-3-ii">ii. If a financial institution obtains two or more AUS results and the AUS generating one of those results corresponds to the purchaser, insurer, or guarantor, if any, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that AUS name and result. For example, if a financial institution evaluates an application with the AUS of Securitizer A and subsequently evaluates the application with the AUS of Securitizer B, but the financial institution ultimately originates a covered loan that it sells within the same calendar year to Securitizer A, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of Securitizer A's AUS and the result generated by that system. If a financial institution obtains two or more AUS results and more than one of those AUS results is generated by a system that corresponds to the purchaser, insurer, or guarantor, if any, the financial institution identifies which AUS result should be reported by following the principle set forth below in comment 4(a)(35)-3.iii.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-3-iii" id="4-a-35-Interp-3-iii">iii. If a financial institution obtains two or more AUS results and none of the systems generating those results correspond to the purchaser, insurer, or guarantor, if any, or the financial institution is following this principle because more than one AUS result is generated by a system that corresponds to either the loan type or the purchaser, insurer, or guarantor, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the AUS result generated closest in time to the credit decision and the name of the AUS that generated that result. For example, if a financial institution evaluates an application with the AUS of Securitizer A, subsequently again evaluates the application with Securitizer A's AUS, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of Securitizer A's AUS and the second AUS result. Similarly, if a financial institution obtains a result from an AUS that requires the financial institution to underwrite the loan manually, but the financial institution subsequently processes the application through a different AUS that also generates a result, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of the second AUS that it used to evaluate the application and the AUS result generated by that system.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-3-iv" id="4-a-35-Interp-3-iv">iv. If a financial institution obtains two or more AUS results at the same time and the principles in comment 4(a)(35)-3.i through .iii do not apply, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of all of the AUSs used by the financial institution to evaluate the application and the results generated by each of those systems. For example, if a financial institution simultaneously evaluates an application with the AUS of Securitizer A and the AUS of Securitizer B, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of both Securitizer A's AUS and Securitizer B's AUS and the results generated by each of those systems. In any event, however, the financial institution does not report more than five AUSs and five results. If more than five AUSs and five results meet the criteria in this principle, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by choosing any five among them to report.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-4" id="4-a-35-Interp-4">4. <strong>Transactions for which an automated underwriting system was not used to evaluate the application.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(35) does not require a financial institution to evaluate an application using an automated underwriting system (AUS), as defined in §&#160;1003.4(a)(35)(ii). For example, if a financial institution only manually underwrites an application and does not use an AUS to evaluate the application, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable since an AUS was not used to evaluate the application.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-5" id="4-a-35-Interp-5">5. <strong>Purchased covered loan.</strong> A financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable when the covered loan is a purchased covered loan.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-6" id="4-a-35-Interp-6">6. <strong>Non-natural person.</strong> When the applicant and co-applicant, if applicable, are not natural persons, a financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-7" id="4-a-35-Interp-7">7. <strong>Determination of securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor.</strong> Section 1003.4(a)(35)(ii) provides that an “automated underwriting system” means an electronic tool developed by a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit that provides a result regarding the credit risk of the applicant and whether the covered loan is eligible to be originated, purchased, insured, or guaranteed by that securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor. A person is a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, respectively, if it has ever securitized, insured, or guaranteed a closed-end mortgage loan or open-end line of credit. If a financial institution knows or reasonably believes that the system it is using to evaluate an application is an electronic tool that has been developed by a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, then the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of that system and the result generated by that system. Knowledge or reasonable belief could, for example, be based on a sales agreement or other related documents, the financial institution's previous transactions or relationship with the developer of the electronic tool, or representations made by the developer of the electronic tool demonstrating that the developer of the electronic tool is a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit. If a financial institution does not know or reasonably believe that the system it is using to evaluate an application is an electronic tool that has been developed by a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit, the financial institution complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable, provided that the financial institution maintains procedures reasonably adapted to determine whether the electronic tool it is using to evaluate an application meets the definition in §&#160;1003.4(a)(35)(ii). Reasonably adapted procedures include attempting to determine with reasonable frequency, such as annually, whether the developer of the electronic tool is a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit. For example:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-7-i" id="4-a-35-Interp-7-i">i. In the course of renewing an annual sales agreement the developer of the electronic tool represents to the financial institution that it has never been a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit. On this basis, the financial institution does not know or reasonably believe that the system it is using to evaluate an application is an electronic tool that has been developed by a securitizer, Federal government insurer, or Federal government guarantor of closed-end mortgage loans or open-end lines of credit and complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting that the requirement is not applicable.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="4-a-35-Interp-7-ii" id="4-a-35-Interp-7-ii">ii. Based on their previous transactions a financial institution is aware that the developer of the electronic tool it is using to evaluate an application has securitized a closed-end mortgage loan or open-end line of credit in the past. On this basis, the financial institution knows or reasonably believes that the developer of the electronic tool is a securitizer and complies with §&#160;1003.4(a)(35) by reporting the name of that system and the result generated by that system.</p>

Section 1003.4(f) does not require a financial institution to record data on a single loan/application register on a quarterly basis. Rather, for purposes of §&#160;1003.4(f), a financial institution may record data on a single loan/application register or separately for different branches or different loan types (such as home purchase or home improvement loans, or loans on multifamily dwellings).</p>

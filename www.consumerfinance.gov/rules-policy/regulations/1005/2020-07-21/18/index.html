<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-a-Interp-1" id="18-a-Interp-1">1. <strong>Issuance of access device.</strong> Consistent with §&#160;1005.5(a) and except as provided, as applicable, in §&#160;1005.5(b), a financial institution may issue an access device only in response to an oral or written request for the device, or as a renewal or substitute for an accepted access device. A consumer is deemed to request an access device for a payroll card account when the consumer chooses to receive salary or other compensation through a payroll card account. A consumer is deemed to request an access device for a prepaid account when, for example, the consumer acquires a prepaid account offered for sale at a retail location or applies for a prepaid account by telephone or online. If an access device for a prepaid account is provided on an unsolicited basis where the prepaid account is used for disbursing funds to a consumer, and the financial institution or third party making the disbursement does not offer any alternative means for the consumer to receive those funds in lieu of accepting the prepaid account, in order to satisfy §&#160;1005.5(b)(2), the financial institution must inform the consumer that the consumer has no other means by which to initially receive the funds in the prepaid account other than by accepting the access device, as well as the consequences of disposing of the access device.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-a-Interp-2" id="18-a-Interp-2">2. <strong>Application to employers and service providers.</strong> Typically, employers and third-party service providers do not meet the definition of a “financial institution” subject to the regulation because they neither hold prepaid accounts (including payroll card accounts) nor issue prepaid cards and agree with consumers to provide EFT services in connection with prepaid accounts. However, to the extent an employer or a service provider undertakes either of these functions, it would be deemed a financial institution under the regulation.</p>

Because §&#160;1005.18(b)(6)(i)(B) provides that electronic disclosures required by §&#160;1005.18(b) need not meet the consumer consent or other applicable provisions of the E-Sign Act, §&#160;1005.18(b) addresses certain requirements for written and electronic pre-acquisition disclosures separately. Section 1005.18(b) also addresses specific requirements for pre-acquisition disclosures provided orally.</p>

For example, a prepaid account sold in a U.S. airport intended for use in England may disclose in pound sterling (£) the fees required to be disclosed in the short form and long form disclosures and outside the short form disclosure, except for the purchase price.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-1-i-Interp-1" id="18-b-1-i-Interp-1">1. <strong>Disclosing the short form and long form before acquisition.</strong> Section 1005.18(b)(1)(i) generally requires delivery of a short form disclosure as described in §&#160;1005.18(b)(2), accompanied by the information required to be disclosed by §&#160;1005.18(b)(5), and a long form disclosure as described in §&#160;1005.18(b)(4) before a consumer acquires a prepaid account.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-1-i-Interp-1-i" id="18-b-1-i-Interp-1-i">i. For purposes of §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(i), a consumer acquires a prepaid account by purchasing, opening or choosing to be paid via a prepaid account, as illustrated by the following examples:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-b-1-i-Interp-1-i-A" id="18-b-1-i-Interp-1-i-A">A. A consumer inquires about obtaining a prepaid account at a branch location of a bank. A consumer then receives the disclosures required by §&#160;1005.18(b). After receiving the disclosures, a consumer then opens a prepaid account with the bank. This consumer received the short form and long form pre-acquisition in accordance with §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-b-1-i-Interp-1-i-B" id="18-b-1-i-Interp-1-i-B">B. A consumer learns that he or she can receive wages via a payroll card account, at which time the consumer is provided with a payroll card and the disclosures required by §&#160;1005.18(b) to review. The consumer then chooses to receive wages via a payroll card account. These disclosures were provided pre-acquisition in compliance with §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(i). By contrast, if a consumer receives the disclosures required by §&#160;1005.18(b) to review at the end of the first pay period, after the consumer received the first payroll payment on the payroll card, these disclosures were provided to a consumer post-acquisition, and thus not provided in compliance with §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-1-i-Interp-1-ii" id="18-b-1-i-Interp-1-ii">ii. Section 1005.18(b)(1)(i) permits delivery of the disclosures required by §&#160;1005.18(b) at the time the consumer receives the prepaid account, rather than prior to acquisition, for prepaid accounts that are used for disbursing funds to consumers when the financial institution or third party making the disbursement does not offer any alternative means for the consumer to receive those funds in lieu of accepting the prepaid account. For example, a utility company refunds consumers’ initial deposits for its utility services via prepaid accounts delivered to consumers by mail. Neither the utility company nor the financial institution that issues the prepaid accounts offer another means for a consumer to receive that refund other than by accepting the prepaid account. In this case, the financial institution may provide the disclosures required by §&#160;1005.18(b) together with the prepaid account (e.g., in the same envelope as the prepaid account); it is not required to deliver the disclosures separately prior to delivery of the prepaid account.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-1-i-Interp-2" id="18-b-1-i-Interp-2">2. <strong>Disclosures provided electronically.</strong> Disclosures required by §&#160;1005.18(b) may be provided before or after a consumer has initiated the process of acquiring a prepaid account electronically. When the disclosures required by §&#160;1005.18(b) are presented after a consumer has initiated the process for acquiring a prepaid account online or via a mobile device, but before a consumer chooses to accept the prepaid account, such disclosures are also made pre-acquisition in accordance with §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(i). The disclosures required by §&#160;1005.18(b) that are provided electronically when a consumer acquires a prepaid account electronically are not considered to be given pre-acquisition unless a consumer must view the web page containing the disclosures before choosing to accept the prepaid account. The following examples illustrate several methods by which a financial institution may present §&#160;1005.18(b) disclosures before a consumer acquires a prepaid account electronically in compliance with §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(i):</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-1-i-Interp-2-i" id="18-b-1-i-Interp-2-i">i.

A consumer must view the web page before choosing to accept the prepaid account.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-1-i-Interp-2-ii" id="18-b-1-i-Interp-2-ii">ii. A financial institution presents the short form disclosure required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(2), together with the information required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(5), on a web page. The financial institution includes, after the short form disclosure or as part of the statement required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(xiii), a link that directs the consumer to a separate web page containing the long form disclosure required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(4). The consumer must view the web page containing the long form disclosure before choosing to accept the prepaid account.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-1-i-Interp-2-iii" id="18-b-1-i-Interp-2-iii">iii. A financial institution presents on a web page the short form disclosure required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(2), together with the information required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(5), followed by the initial disclosures required by §&#160;1005.7(b), which contains the long form disclosure required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(4), in accordance with §&#160;1005.18(f)(1). The financial institution includes, after the short form disclosure or as part of the statement required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(xiii), a link that directs the consumer to the section of the initial disclosures containing the long form disclosure pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(4).

For purposes of §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(ii), a retail location is a store or other physical site where a consumer can purchase a prepaid account in person and that is operated by an entity other than the financial institution that issues the prepaid account. A branch of a financial institution that offers its own prepaid accounts is not a retail location with respect to those accounts and, thus, both the short form and the long form disclosure must be provided pre-acquisition pursuant to the timing requirement set forth in §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-1-ii-Interp-2" id="18-b-1-ii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Disclosures provided inside prepaid account access device packaging material.</strong> Except when providing the long form disclosure post-acquisition in accordance with the retail location exception set forth in §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(ii), the disclosures required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(2), (4), and (5) must be provided to a consumer pre-acquisition in compliance with §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(i). A short form disclosure is not considered to have been provided pre-acquisition if, for example, it is inside the packaging material accompanying a prepaid account access device such that the consumer cannot see or access the disclosure before acquiring the prepaid account.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-1-ii-Interp-3" id="18-b-1-ii-Interp-3">3. <strong>Consumers working in retail locations.</strong> A payroll card account offered to consumers working in retail locations is not eligible for the retail location exception in §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(ii); thus, a consumer employee must receive both the short form and long form disclosures for the payroll card account pre-acquisition pursuant to the timing requirement set forth in §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-1-ii-Interp-4" id="18-b-1-ii-Interp-4">4. <strong>Providing the long form disclosure by telephone and website pursuant to the retail location exception.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(ii), a financial institution may provide the long form disclosure described in §&#160;1005.18(b)(4) after a consumer acquires a prepaid account in a retail location, if the conditions set forth in §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) are met. Pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(ii)(C), a financial institution must make the long form disclosure accessible to consumers by telephone and via a website when not providing a written version of the long form disclosure pre-acquisition. A financial institution may, for example, provide the long form disclosure by telephone using an interactive voice response or similar system or by using a customer service agent.

The cash reload fee includes the cost of adding cash to the prepaid account at a point-of-sale terminal, the cost of purchasing an additional card or other device on which cash is loaded and then transferred into the prepaid account, or any other method a consumer may use to reload cash into the prepaid account. For example, a financial institution does not have its own proprietary cash reload network and instead contracts with a third-party reload network for this service. The financial institution itself does not charge any fee related to cash reloads but the third-party reload network charges a fee of $3.95 per cash reload. The financial institution must disclose the cash reload fee as $3.95. If the financial institution offers more than one method to reload cash into the prepaid account, §&#160;1005.18(b)(3)(i) requires disclosure of the highest cash reload fee. For example, a financial institution contracts with two third-party cash reload networks; one third party charges $3.95 for a point-of-sale reload and the other third party charges $2.95 for purchase of a reload pack. In addition to the third-party cash reload charge, the financial institution charges a $1 fee for every cash reload. The financial institution must disclose the cash reload fee on the short form as $4.95, that is, the highest third-party fee plus the financial institution’s $1 fee. <em>See</em> comment 18(b)(3)(v)–1 for additional guidance regarding third-party fees for cash reloads.</p>

The following clarify which fee types to include in the total number of additional fee types:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-viii-A-Interp-1-i" id="18-b-2-viii-A-Interp-1-i">i. <strong>Fee types excluded from the number of additional fee types.</strong> The number of additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) does not include the fees otherwise required to be disclosed in the short form pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(i) through (vii), nor any purchase fee or activation fee required to be disclosed outside the short form pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(5). It also does not include any finance charges as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11), imposed in connection with a credit feature defined in 12 CFR 1026.61. The number of additional fee types includes only fee types under which the financial institution may charge fees; accordingly, third-party fees are not included unless they are imposed for services performed on behalf of the financial institution. In addition, the number of additional fee types includes only fee types the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account; accordingly, additional fee types does not include other revenue sources such as interchange fees or fees paid by employers for payroll card programs, government agencies for government benefit programs, or other entities sponsoring prepaid account programs for financial disbursements.</p>

For example, the ATM withdrawal and ATM balance inquiry fee types required to be disclosed respectively by §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(iii) and (v) that are excluded from the number of additional fee types pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(viii) do not include such services outside of the United States. Thus, any international ATM fees charged by the financial institution for ATM withdrawal or balance inquiries must each be counted in the total number of additional fee types. Similarly, any fees for reloading funds into a prepaid account in a form other than cash (such as electronic reload and check reload, as described in comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)–2) must be counted in the total number of additional fee types because §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(iv) is limited to cash reloads. Also, additional fee types disclosed in the short form pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix) must be counted in the total number of additional fee types.</p>

A financial institution may charge only one fee within a particular fee type, or may charge two or more variations of fees within the same fee type. The following is a list of examples of fee types a financial institution may use when determining both the number of additional fee types charged pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(viii)(A) and any additional fee types to disclose pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix).

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-1" id="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-1">1. <strong>Number of fee types to disclose.</strong> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) requires disclosure of the two fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the time period provided in §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E), excluding the categories set forth in §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1) through (3). <em>See</em> comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)–2 for guidance on and examples of fee types. If a prepaid account program has two fee types that satisfy the criteria in §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), it must disclose both fees. If a prepaid account program has three or more fee types that potentially satisfy the criteria in §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the financial institution must disclose only the two fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers. <em>See</em> comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(B)–1 for guidance regarding the disclosure of additional fee types for a prepaid account with fewer than two fee types that satisfy the criteria in §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-2" id="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-2">2. <strong>Abbreviations.</strong> Commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations may be used as needed for additional fee types and fee variations disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix). For example, to accommodate on one line in the short form disclosure the additional fee types “international ATM balance inquiry” or “person-to-person transfer of funds,” with or without fee variations, a financial institution may choose to abbreviate the fee type name as “Int’l ATM inquiry” or “P2P transfer.”</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-3" id="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-3">3. <strong>Revenue from consumers.</strong> The revenue calculation for the disclosure of additional fee types pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A) is based on fee types that the financial institution may charge consumers with respect to the prepaid account. The calculation excludes other revenue sources such as revenue generated from interchange fees and fees paid by employers for payroll card programs, government agencies for government benefit programs, and other entities sponsoring prepaid account programs for financial disbursements. It also excludes third-party fees, unless they are imposed for services performed on behalf of the financial institution.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-4" id="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-4">4. <strong>Assessing revenue within and across prepaid account programs to determine disclosure of additional fee types.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the disclosure of the two fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers must be determined for each prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule. Thus, if a financial institution offers more than one prepaid account program, unless the programs share the same fee schedule, the financial institution must consider the fee revenue data separately for each prepaid account program and not consolidate the fee revenue data across prepaid account programs. Prepaid account programs are deemed to have the same fee schedules if they charge the same fee amounts, including offering the same fee waivers and fee reductions for the same features. The following examples illustrate how to assess revenue within and across prepaid account programs to determine the disclosure of additional fee types:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-4-i" id="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-4-i">i. <strong>Prepaid account programs with different fee schedules.</strong> A financial institution offers multiple prepaid account programs and each program has a different fee schedule. The financial institution must consider the revenue from consumers for each program separately; it may not consider the revenue from all of its prepaid account programs together in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for its programs.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-4-ii" id="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-4-ii">ii. <strong>Prepaid account programs with identical fee schedules.</strong> A financial institution offers multiple prepaid account programs and they all share the same fee schedule. The financial institution may consider the revenue across all of its prepaid account programs together in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for its programs.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-4-iii" id="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-4-iii">iii. <strong>Prepaid account programs with both different fee schedules and identical fee schedules.</strong> A financial institution offers multiple prepaid account programs, some of which share the same fee schedule. The financial institution may consider the revenue across all prepaid account programs with identical fee schedules in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for those programs. The financial institution must separately consider the revenue from each of the prepaid account programs with unique fee schedules.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-4-iv" id="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-4-iv">iv. <strong>Multiple service plan prepaid account programs.</strong> A financial institution that discloses multiple service plans on a short form disclosure as permitted by §&#160;1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2) must consider revenue across all of those plans in determining the disclosure of additional fee types for that program. If, however, the financial institution instead is disclosing the default service plan pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(1), the financial institution must consider the revenue generated from consumers for the default service plan only. <em>See</em> §&#160;1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2) and comment 18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2)–1 for guidance on what constitutes multiple service plans.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-5" id="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-5">5. <strong>Exclusions.</strong> Once the financial institution has calculated the fee revenue data for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the appropriate time period, it must remove from consideration the categories excluded pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1) through (3) before determining the fee types, if any, that generated the highest revenue.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-5-i" id="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-5-i">i. <strong>Exclusion for fee types required to be disclosed elsewhere.</strong> Fee types otherwise required to be disclosed in or outside the short form are excluded from the additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1). Thus, the following fee types are excluded: Periodic fee, per purchase fee, ATM withdrawal fees (for ATM withdrawals in the United States), cash reload fee, ATM balance inquiry fees (for ATM balance inquiries in the United States), customer service fees, and inactivity fee. However, while the cash reload fee type is excluded, other reload fee types, such as electronic reload and check reload, are not excluded under §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1) and thus may be disclosed as additional fee types pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Similarly, while the fee types ATM withdrawal and ATM balance inquiry in the United States are excluded, international ATM withdrawal and international ATM balance inquiry fees are not excluded under §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1) and thus may be disclosed as additional fee types pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Also pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(1), the purchase price and activation fee, if any, required to be disclosed outside the short form disclosure pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(5), are excluded from the additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-5-ii" id="18-b-2-ix-A-Interp-5-ii">ii. <strong>De minimis exclusion.</strong> Any fee types that generated less than 5 percent of the total revenue from consumers for the prepaid account program or across prepaid account programs that share the same fee schedule during the time period provided in §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D) and (E) are excluded from the additional fee types required to be disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A)(2). For example, for a particular prepaid account program over the appropriate time period, bill payment, check reload, and card replacement are the only fee types that generated 5 percent or more of the total revenue from consumers at, respectively, 15 percent, 10 percent, and 7 percent. Two other fee types, legal fee and personalized card, generated revenue below 1 percent of the total revenue from consumers. The financial institution must disclose bill payment and check reload as the additional fee types for that particular prepaid account program because those two fee types generated the highest revenue from consumers from among the categories not excluded from disclosure as additional fee types. For a different prepaid account program over the appropriate time period, bill payment is the only fee type that generated 5 percent or more of the total revenue from consumers. Two other fee types, check reload and card replacement, each generated revenue below 5 percent of the total revenue from consumers. The financial institution must disclose bill payment as an additional fee type for that particular prepaid account program because it is the only fee type that satisfies the criteria of §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A). The financial institution may, but is not required to, disclose either check reload or card replacement on the short form as well, pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(B). <em>See</em> comment 18(b)(2)(ix)(B)–1.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-2-ix-C-Interp-1" id="18-b-2-ix-C-Interp-1">1. <strong>Two or more fee variations.</strong> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C) specifies how to disclose additional fee types with two fee variations, more than two fee variations, and for multiple service plans pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2). <em>See</em> comment 18(b)(2)(viii)(A)–2 for guidance on and examples of fee types and fee variations within those fee types. The following examples illustrate how to disclose two-tier fees and other fee variations in additional fee types:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-ix-C-Interp-1-i" id="18-b-2-ix-C-Interp-1-i">i. <strong>Two fee variations with different fee amounts.</strong> A financial institution charges a fee of $1 for providing a card replacement using standard mail service and charges a fee of $5 for providing a card replacement using expedited delivery. The financial institution must calculate the total revenue generated from consumers for all card replacements, both via standard mail service and expedited delivery, during the required time period to determine whether it is required to disclose card replacement as an additional fee type pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Because there are only two fee variations for the fee type “card replacement,” if card replacement is required to be disclosed as an additional fee type pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the financial institution must disclose both fee variations pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C). Thus, the financial institution would disclose on the short form the fee type and two variations as “Card replacement (regular or expedited delivery)” and the fee amount as “$1.00 or $5.00”.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-ix-C-Interp-1-ii" id="18-b-2-ix-C-Interp-1-ii">ii. <strong>More than two fee variations.</strong> A financial institution offers two methods of bill payment—via ACH and paper check—and offers two modes of delivery for bill payments made by paper check—regular standard mail service and expedited delivery. The financial institution charges $0.25 for bill pay via ACH, $0.50 for bill pay via paper check sent by regular standard mail service, and $3 for bill pay via paper check sent via expedited delivery. The financial institution must calculate the total revenue generated from consumers for all methods of bill pay and all modes of delivery during the required time period to determine whether it must disclose bill payment as an additional fee type pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Because there are more than two fee variations for the fee type “bill payment,” if bill payment is required to be disclosed as an additional fee type pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(A), the financial institution has two options for the disclosure. The financial institution may disclose the highest fee, $3, followed by a symbol, such as an asterisk, linked to a statement explaining that the fee could be lower depending on how and where the prepaid account is used, pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(3)(i). Thus, the financial institution would disclose on the short form the fee type as “Bill payment” and the fee amount as “$3.00&#42;”. Alternatively, the financial institution may consolidate the fee variations into two categories, such as regular delivery and expedited delivery. In this case, the financial institution would make this disclosure on the short form as: “Bill payment (regular or expedited delivery)” and the fee amount as “$0.50&#42; or $3.00”.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-ix-C-Interp-1-iii" id="18-b-2-ix-C-Interp-1-iii">iii. <strong>Two fee variations with like fee amounts.</strong> A financial institution offers two methods of check reload for which it charges a fee—depositing checks at an ATM and depositing checks with a teller at the financial institution’s branch locations. There is a fee of $0.50 for both methods of check deposit. The financial institution must calculate the total revenue generated from both of these check reload methods during the required time period to determine whether it must disclose this fee type as an additional fee type pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Because the fee amounts are the same for the two methods of check deposit, if the fee type is required to be disclosed as an additional fee type, the financial institution’s options for disclosing this fee type in accordance with §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C) and (b)(3)(iii) include: “Check reload (ATM or teller check dep)” and the fee amount as “$0.50” or “Check reload” and the fee amount as “$0.50”.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-ix-C-Interp-1-iv" id="18-b-2-ix-C-Interp-1-iv">iv. <strong>Multiple service plans.</strong> A financial institution provides a short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2). Notwithstanding that an additional fee type has only two fee variations, a financial institution must disclose the highest fee in accordance with §&#160;1005.18(b)(3)(i).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-2-ix-C-Interp-2" id="18-b-2-ix-C-Interp-2">2. <strong>One fee variation under a particular fee type.</strong> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C) provides in part that, if a financial institution only charges one fee under a particular fee type, the financial institution must disclose the name of the additional fee type and the fee amount; it may, but is not required to, disclose also the name of the one fee variation, if any, for which the fee amount is charged, in a format substantially similar to that used to disclose the two-tier fees required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(v) and (vi), except that the financial institution must disclose only the one fee variation name and fee amount instead of two. For example, a financial institution offers one method of electronic reload for which it charges a fee—electronic reload conducted using a debit card. The financial institution must calculate the total revenue generated from consumers for the fee type electronic reload (i.e., in this case, electronic reloads conducted using a debit card) during the required time period to determine whether it must disclose electronic reload as an additional fee type pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix). Because the financial institution only charges one fee variation under the fee type electronic reload, if this fee type is required to be disclosed as an additional fee type, the financial institution has two options for disclosing this fee type in accordance with §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(C): “Electronic reload (debit card)” and the fee amount as “$1.00” or “Electronic reload” and the fee amount as “$1.00”.</p>

The financial institution must complete this reassessment and update its disclosure, if applicable, within three months of the end of the 24-month period, except as provided in the update printing exception in §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4). The following examples provide guidance on the periodic assessment and, if applicable, update of the disclosure of additional fee types pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(2):</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-ix-E-2-Interp-1-i" id="18-b-2-ix-E-2-Interp-1-i">i. <strong>Reassessment with no change in the additional fee types disclosed.</strong> A financial institution disclosed two additional fee types (bill payment and card replacement) for a particular prepaid account program on April 1, 2019. Starting on April 1, 2021, the financial institution assessed the fee revenue data it collected over the previous 24 months, and the two additional fee types previously disclosed continue to qualify as additional fee types pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix). The financial institution is not required to take any action with regard to the disclosure of additional fee types for that prepaid account program.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-ix-E-2-Interp-1-ii" id="18-b-2-ix-E-2-Interp-1-ii">ii. <strong>Reassessment with a change in the additional fee types disclosed.</strong> A financial institution disclosed two additional fee types (bill payment and card replacement) for a particular prepaid account program on April 1, 2019. Starting on April 1, 2021, the financial institution assessed the fee revenue data it collected over the previous 24 months, and bill payment continued to qualify as an additional fee type pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix) but check reload qualified as the second additional fee type instead of card replacement. The financial institution must update the additional fee types disclosure in its short form disclosures provided electronically, orally, and in writing (other than for printed materials that qualify for the update printing exception in §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4)) no later than July 1, 2021, which is three months after the end of the 24-month period.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-2-ix-E-2-Interp-1-iii" id="18-b-2-ix-E-2-Interp-1-iii">iii. <strong>Reassessment with the addition of an additional fee type already voluntarily disclosed.</strong> A financial institution disclosed one additional fee type (bill payment) and voluntarily disclosed one other additional fee type (card replacement, both for regular and expedited delivery) for a particular prepaid account program on April 1, 2019. Starting on April 1, 2021, the financial institution assessed the fee revenue data it collected over the previous 24 months, and bill payment continued to qualify as an additional fee type pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix) and card replacement now qualified as the second additional fee type. Because the financial institution already had disclosed its card replacement fees in the format required for an additional fee type disclosure, the financial institution is not required to take any action with regard to the additional fee types disclosure in the short form for that prepaid account program.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-2-ix-E-2-Interp-2" id="18-b-2-ix-E-2-Interp-2">2. <strong>Reassessment more frequently than every 24 months.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(2), a financial institution may, but is not required to, carry out the reassessment and update, if applicable, more frequently than every 24 months, at which time a new 24-month period commences. A financial institution may choose to do this, for example, to sync its reassessment process for additional fee types with its financial reporting schedule or other financial analysis it performs regarding the particular prepaid account program. If a financial institution chooses to reassess its additional fee types disclosure more frequently than every 24 months, it is still required to use 24 months of fee revenue data to conduct the reassessment. For example, a financial institution first offered a particular prepaid account program on April 1, 2018 and thus was required to estimate its initial additional fee types disclosure pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(D)(2). If the financial institution chooses to begin its reassessment of its fee revenue data on April 1, 2020, it would use the data it collected over the previous 24 months (April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2020) and complete its reassessment and its update, if applicable, by July 1, 2020.</p>

If the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will not comply with the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2)(ix), it must update the disclosure based on its reasonable anticipation of what those additional fee types will be at the time the fee schedule change goes into effect, except as provided in the update printing exception in paragraph (b)(2)(ix)(E)(4) of this section. If an immediate change in terms and conditions is necessary to maintain or restore the security of an account or an electronic fund transfer system as described in §&#160;1005.8(a)(2) and that change affects the prepaid account program’s fee schedule, the financial institution must complete its reassessment and update its disclosure, if applicable, within three months of the date it makes the change permanent, except as provided in the update printing exception in paragraph (b)(2)(ix)(E)(4) of this section.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-2-ix-E-3-Interp-1" id="18-b-2-ix-E-3-Interp-1">1. <strong>Revised prepaid account programs.</strong> Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(3) requires that if a financial institution revises the fee schedule for a prepaid account program, it must determine whether it reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will continue to comply with the requirements of §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix) for the 24 months following implementation of the fee schedule change. A fee schedule change resets the 24-month period for assessment; a financial institution must comply with the requirements of §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(2) at the end of the 24-month period following implementation of the fee schedule change. If the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will not comply with the requirements of §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix), it must update the disclosure based on its reasonable anticipation of what those additional fee types will be at the time the fee schedule change goes into effect, except as provided in the update printing exception in §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4). For example, if a financial institution lowers its card replacement fee from $4 to $3 on June 1, 2019 after having first assessed its additional fee types disclosure as of April 1, 2019, the financial institution would assess whether it reasonably anticipates that the existing additional fee types disclosure will continue to reflect the additional fee types that generate the highest revenue from consumers for that prepaid account program for the next 24 months (until June 1, 2021). If the financial institution reasonably anticipates that its additional fee types will remain unchanged over the next 24 months, the financial institution is not required to take any action with regard to the additional fee types disclosure for that prepaid account program. In the same example, if the financial institution reasonably anticipates that the previously disclosed additional fee types will not comply with the requirements of §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix) for the 24 months following implementation of the fee schedule change, the financial institution must update the listing of additional fee types at the time the fee schedule change goes into effect, except as provided in the update printing exception pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4).</p>

For prepaid accounts sold in retail locations, for example, §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4) permits a financial institution to implement any necessary updates to the listing of the additional fee types on the short form disclosure that appear on its physical prepaid account packaging materials at the time the financial institution prints new materials. Section 1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4) does not require financial institutions to destroy existing inventory in retail locations or elsewhere in the distribution channel, to the extent the disclosures on such packaging materials are otherwise accurate, to comply with this requirement. For example, a financial institution determines that an additional fee type listed on a short form disclosure in a retail location no longer qualifies as an additional fee type pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix). The financial institution must update any electronic and oral short form disclosures pursuant to the timing requirements set forth in §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E). Pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(ix)(E)(4), the financial institution may continue selling any previously printed prepaid account packages that contain the prior listing of additional fee types; prepaid account packages printed after that time must contain the updated listing of additional fee types.</p>

For example, a financial institution that requires a consumer to navigate various other web pages before viewing the long form disclosure would not be deemed to provide direct access pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(xiii). Trademark and product names and their commonly accepted or readily understandable abbreviations comply with the requirement in §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(xiii) that the URL be meaningfully named.

For example, a financial institution provides interactive voice response (IVR) customer service for free and provides the first three live agent customer service calls per month for free, after which it charges $0.50 for each additional live agent customer service call during that month. Pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(vi), the financial institution must disclose both its IVR and live agent customer service fees on the short form disclosure. The financial institution would disclose the IVR fee as $0 and the live agent customer service fee as $0.50, followed by an asterisk (or other symbol) linked to a statement explaining that the fee can be lower depending on how and where the prepaid account is used. Except as described in §&#160;1005.18(b)(3)(ii), §&#160;1005.18(b)(3)(i) does not permit a financial institution to describe in the short form disclosure the specific conditions under which a fee may be reduced or waived, but the financial institution could use, for example, any other part of the prepaid account’s packaging or other printed materials to disclose that information. The conditions under which a fee may be lower are required to be disclosed in the long form disclosure pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(4)(ii).</p>

For example, a financial institution charges a monthly fee of $4.95, but waives this fee if a consumer receives direct deposit into the prepaid account or conducts 30 or more transactions during that month. Pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(3)(ii), the financial institution could list its monthly fee of $4.95 on the short form disclosure followed by a dagger symbol that links to a statement that states, for example, “No monthly fee with direct deposit or 30 transactions per month.” This statement may take up no more than one line of text in the short form disclosure and must be located directly above or in place of the linked statement required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(3)(i).

For example, at the time a financial institution first prints packaging material for its prepaid account program, it discloses on the short form the $3.99 fee charged by the third-party reload network with which it contracts to provide cash reloads. Ten months later, the third-party reload network raises its cash reload fee to $4.25. The financial institution is not required to update its on-package disclosures to reflect the change in the cash reload fee until the financial institution next prints packaging materials for that prepaid account program. With respect to that financial institution’s electronic and oral disclosures for that prepaid account program, the financial institution may, but is not required to, update its short form disclosure immediately upon learning of the third-party reload network’s change to its cash reload fee. Alternatively, the financial institution may wait to update its electronic and oral short form disclosures to reflect the change in the cash reload fee until it otherwise updates those disclosures.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-4-ii-Interp-1" id="18-b-4-ii-Interp-1">1. <strong>Disclosure of all fees.</strong> Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) requires a financial institution to disclose in the long form all fees that may be imposed in connection with a prepaid account, not just fees for electronic fund transfers or the right to make transfers. The requirement to disclose all fees in the long form includes any finance charges imposed on the prepaid account as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in 12 CFR 1026.61 but does not include finance charges imposed on the covered separate credit feature as described in 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(i). <em>See</em> comment 18(b)(7)(i)(B)–2 for guidance on disclosure of finance charges as part of the §&#160;1005.18(b)(4)(ii) fee disclosure in the long form. A financial institution may also be required to include finance charges in the Regulation Z disclosures required pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(4)(vii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-4-ii-Interp-2" id="18-b-4-ii-Interp-2">2. <strong>Disclosure of conditions.</strong> Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) requires a financial institution to disclose the amount of each fee and the conditions, if any, under which the fee may be imposed, waived, or reduced. For example, if a financial institution charges a cash reload fee, the financial institution must list the amount of the cash reload fee and also specify any circumstances under which a consumer can qualify for a lower fee. Similarly, if a financial institution discloses both a periodic fee and an inactivity fee, it must indicate whether the inactivity fee will be charged in addition to, or instead of, the periodic fee. A financial institution may, but is not required to, also include on the long form disclosure additional information or limitations related to the service or feature for which a fee is charged, such as, for cash reloads, any limit on the amount of cash a consumer may load into the prepaid account in a single transaction or during a particular time period. The general requirement in §&#160;1005.18(b)(4)(ii) does not apply to individual fee waivers or reductions granted to a particular consumer or group of consumers on a discretionary or case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-4-ii-Interp-3" id="18-b-4-ii-Interp-3">3. <strong>Disclosure of a service or feature without a charge.</strong> Pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(4)(ii), a financial institution may, but is not required to, list in the long form disclosure any service or feature it provides or offers at no charge to the consumer. For example, a financial institution may list “online bill pay” in its long form disclosure and indicate a fee amount of “$0” when the financial institution does not charge consumers a fee for that feature. By contrast, where a fee is waived or reduced under certain circumstances or where a service or feature is available for an introductory period without a fee, the financial institution may not list the fee amount as “$0”. Rather, the financial institution must list the highest fee, accompanied by an explanation of the waived or reduced fee amount and any conditions for the waiver or discount. For example, if a financial institution waives its monthly fee for any consumer who receives direct deposit payments into the prepaid account or conducts 30 or more transactions in a given month, the long form disclosure must list the regular monthly fee amount along with an explanation that the monthly fee is waived if the consumer receives direct deposit or conducts 30 or more transactions each month. Similarly, for an introductory fee, the financial institution would list the highest fee, and explain the introductory fee amount, the duration of the introductory period, and any conditions that apply during the introductory period.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-4-ii-Interp-4" id="18-b-4-ii-Interp-4">4. <strong>Third-party fees.</strong> Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) requires disclosure in the long form of any third-party fee amounts known to the financial institution that may apply. Fees imposed by another party, such as a program manager, for services performed on behalf of the financial institution are not third-party fees and therefore must be disclosed on the long form pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(4)(ii). Also pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(4)(ii), for any third-party fee disclosed, a financial institution may, but is not required to, include either or both a statement that the fee is accurate as of or through a specific date or that the third-party fee is subject to change. For example, a financial institution that contracts with a third-party remote deposit capture service must include in the long form disclosure the amount of the fee known to the financial institution that is charged by the third party for remote deposit capture services. The financial institution may, but is not required to, also state that the third-party remote deposit capture fee is accurate as of or through a specific date, such as the date the financial institution prints the long form disclosure. The financial institution may also state that the fee is subject to change. Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) also provides that, if a third-party fee may apply but the amount of the fee is not known by the financial institution, it must include a statement indicating that a third-party fee may apply without specifying the fee amount. For example, a financial institution that permits out-of-network ATM withdrawals would disclose that, for ATM withdrawals that occur outside the financial institution’s network, the ATM operator may charge the consumer a fee for the withdrawal, but the financial institution is not required to disclose the out-of-network ATM operator’s fee amount if it does not know the amount of the fee.</p>

For example, if the financial institution provides the short form disclosure online, the information required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form if it appears on the same web page as the short form disclosure. If the financial institution offers the prepaid account in its own branch locations and provides the short form disclosure on the exterior of its preprinted packaging materials, the information required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure if it appears on the exterior of the packaging. If the financial institution provides a written short form disclosure in a manner other than on preprinted packaging materials, such as on paper, the information required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity if it appears on the same piece of paper as the short form disclosure. If the financial institution provides the short form disclosure orally, the information required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(5) is deemed disclosed in close proximity to the short form disclosure if it is provided immediately before or after disclosing the fees and information required pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(2). For prepaid accounts sold in a retail location pursuant to the retail location exception in §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(ii), §&#160;1005.18(b)(5) requires the information other than purchase price be disclosed on the exterior of the access device’s packaging material. If the purchase price, if any, is not also disclosed on the exterior of the packaging, disclosure of the purchase price on or near the sales rack or display for the packaging material is deemed in close proximity to the access device’s packaging material.</p>

For example, the disclosures permitted by §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) or (b)(3)(ii) must take up no more than one additional line of text in the short form disclosure. If a consumer is acquiring a prepaid account using a mobile device with a screen too small to accommodate these disclosures on one line of text in accordance with the size requirements set forth in §&#160;1005.18(b)(7)(ii)(B), a financial institution is permitted to display the disclosures permitted by §&#160;1005.18(b)(2)(xiv)(B) and (b)(3)(ii), for example, by stacking those disclosures in a way that responds to smaller screen sizes, while still meeting the other formatting requirements in §&#160;1005.18(b)(7).</p>

For example, a financial institution that offers a prepaid account program with one service plan for which a consumer pays no periodic fee but instead pays a fee for each transaction, and another plan that includes a monthly fee but no per transaction fee may use the short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2). Similarly, a financial institution that offers a prepaid account program with preferred rates or fees for the prepaid accounts of consumers who also use another non-prepaid service (e.g., a mobile phone service), often referred to as “loyalty plans,” may also use the short form disclosure for multiple service plans pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(6)(iii)(B)(2). Pricing variations based on whether a consumer elects to use a specific feature of a prepaid account, such as waiver of the monthly fee for consumers electing to receive direct deposit, does not constitute multiple service plans or a loyalty plan. <em>See</em> comment 18(b)(3)(iii)–1.ii for guidance on providing a single disclosure for like fees for multiple service plan short form disclosures.</p>

Pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(7)(i)(B), text describing the conditions under which a fee may be imposed must appear in the table in the long form disclosure in close proximity to the fee amount disclosed pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(4)(ii). For example, a financial institution is deemed to comply with this requirement if the text describing the conditions is located directly to the right of the fee amount in the long form disclosure, as illustrated in Sample Form A–10(f). <em>See</em> comment 18(b)(6)(i)(B)–2 regarding stacking of electronic disclosures for display on smaller screen sizes.</p>

If any finance charges may be imposed on the prepaid account as described in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), in connection with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in 12 CFR 1026.61, the financial institution may, but is not required to, group all finance charges together under a single subheading. This includes situations where the financial institution imposes a higher fee or charge on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card than the amount of a comparable fee or charge it imposes on any prepaid account in the same prepaid account program that does not have such a credit feature. For example, if a financial institution charges on the prepaid account a $0.50 per transaction fee for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account and a $1.25 per transaction fee for each transaction where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction, the financial institution is permitted to disclose the $0.50 per transaction fee under a general transactional subheading and disclose the additional $0.75 per transaction fee under a separate subheading together with any other finance charges that may be imposed on the prepaid account.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-1-i" id="18-b-9-Interp-1-i">i. <strong>Examples of situations in which foreign language disclosures are required.</strong> The following examples illustrate situations in which a financial institution must provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language in connection with the acquisition of that prepaid account:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-1-i-A" id="18-b-9-Interp-1-i-A">A. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language on the packaging material of a prepaid account sold in a retail location or distributed at a bank or credit union branch, even though a few words appear in English on the packaging.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-1-i-B" id="18-b-9-Interp-1-i-B">B. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language in a television advertisement for a prepaid account. That advertisement includes a telephone number a consumer can call to acquire the prepaid account, whether by speaking to a customer service representative or interacting with an interactive voice response (IVR) system.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-1-i-C" id="18-b-9-Interp-1-i-C">C. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language in an online advertisement for a prepaid account. That advertisement includes a website URL through which a consumer can acquire the prepaid account.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-1-i-D" id="18-b-9-Interp-1-i-D">D. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language on a printed advertisement for a prepaid account. That advertisement includes a telephone number or a website URL a consumer can call or visit to acquire the prepaid account. The pre-acquisition disclosures must be provided to the consumer in that same foreign language prior to the consumer acquiring the prepaid account.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-1-i-E" id="18-b-9-Interp-1-i-E">E. The financial institution does not principally use a foreign language on prepaid account packaging material nor does it principally use a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account. A consumer calls the financial institution and has the option to proceed with the prepaid account acquisition process in a foreign language, whether by speaking to a customer service representative or interacting with an IVR system. (<em>But see</em> §&#160;1005.18(b)(9)(i)(C), which limits the obligation to provide foreign language disclosures for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts acquired orally by telephone in certain circumstances.)</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-1-i-F" id="18-b-9-Interp-1-i-F">F. The financial institution does not principally use a foreign language on prepaid account packaging material nor does it principally use a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account. A consumer visits the financial institution’s website. On that website, the consumer has the option to proceed with the prepaid account acquisition process in a foreign language.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-1-ii" id="18-b-9-Interp-1-ii">ii. <strong>Examples of situations in which foreign language disclosures are not required.</strong> The following examples illustrate situations in which a financial institution is not required to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-1-ii-A" id="18-b-9-Interp-1-ii-A">A. A consumer visits the financial institution’s branch location in person and speaks to an employee in a foreign language about acquiring a prepaid account. The consumer proceeds with the acquisition process in that foreign language.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-1-ii-B" id="18-b-9-Interp-1-ii-B">B. The financial institution does not principally use a foreign language on prepaid account packaging material nor does it principally use a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account. A consumer calls the financial institution’s customer service line and speaks to a customer service representative in a foreign language. However, if the customer service representative proceeds with the prepaid account acquisition process over the telephone, the financial institution would be required to provide the pre-acquisition disclosures in that foreign language. (<em>But see</em> §&#160;1005.18(b)(9)(i)(C), which limits the obligation to provide foreign language disclosures for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts acquired orally by telephone in certain circumstances.)</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-1-ii-C" id="18-b-9-Interp-1-ii-C">C. The financial institution principally uses a foreign language in an advertisement for a prepaid account. That advertisement includes a telephone number a consumer can call to acquire the prepaid account. The consumer calls the telephone number provided on the advertisement and has the option to proceed with the prepaid account acquisition process in English or in a foreign language. The consumer chooses to proceed with the acquisition process in English.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-1-ii-D" id="18-b-9-Interp-1-ii-D">D. A consumer calls a government agency to enroll in a government benefits program. The government agency does not offer through its telephone system an option for consumers to proceed in a foreign language. An employee of the government agency assists the consumer with the enrollment process, including helping the consumer acquire a government benefits account. The employee also happens to speak the foreign language in which the consumer is most comfortable communicating, and chooses to communicate with the consumer in that language to facilitate the enrollment process. In this case, the employee offered language interpretation assistance on an informal or ad hoc basis to accommodate the prospective government benefits account holder.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-2" id="18-b-9-Interp-2">2. <strong>Principally used.</strong> All relevant facts and circumstances determine whether a foreign language is principally used by the financial institution to advertise, solicit, or market under §&#160;1005.18(b)(9). Whether a foreign language is principally used is determined at the packaging material, advertisement, solicitation, or marketing communication level, not at the prepaid account program level or across the financial institution’s activities as a whole. A financial institution that advertises a prepaid account program in multiple languages would evaluate its use of foreign language in each advertisement to determine whether it has principally used a foreign language therein.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-3" id="18-b-9-Interp-3">3. <strong>Advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account.</strong> Any commercial message, appearing in any medium, that promotes directly or indirectly the availability of prepaid accounts constitutes advertising, soliciting, or marketing for purposes of §&#160;1005.18(b)(9). Examples illustrating advertising, soliciting, or marketing include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-3-i" id="18-b-9-Interp-3-i">i. Messages in a leaflet, promotional flyer, newspaper, or magazine.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-3-ii" id="18-b-9-Interp-3-ii">ii. Electronic messages, such as on a website or mobile application.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-3-iii" id="18-b-9-Interp-3-iii">iii. Telephone solicitations.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-3-iv" id="18-b-9-Interp-3-iv">iv. Solicitations sent to the consumer by mail or email.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-3-v" id="18-b-9-Interp-3-v">v. Television or radio commercials.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-b-9-Interp-4" id="18-b-9-Interp-4">4. <strong>Information in the long form disclosure in English.</strong> Section 1005.18(b)(9)(ii) states that a financial institution required to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(9)(i) must also provide the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(b)(4) in English upon a consumer’s request and on any part of the website where it discloses this information in a foreign language. A financial institution may, but is not required to, provide the English version of the information required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(4) in accordance with the formatting, grouping, size and other requirements set forth in §&#160;1005.18(b) for the long form disclosure.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="b-9-i" id="b-9-i"><strong>(i) General.</strong> A financial institution must provide the pre-acquisition disclosures required by paragraph (b) of this section in a foreign language, if the financial institution uses that same foreign language in connection with the acquisition of a prepaid account in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="b-9-i-A" id="b-9-i-A"><strong>(A)</strong> The financial institution principally uses a foreign language on the prepaid account packaging material;</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="b-9-i-B" id="b-9-i-B"><strong>(B)</strong> The financial institution principally uses a foreign language to advertise, solicit, or market a prepaid account and provides a means in the advertisement, solicitation, or marketing material that the consumer uses to acquire the prepaid account by telephone or electronically; or</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-3" data-label="b-9-i-C" id="b-9-i-C"><strong>(C)</strong> The financial institution provides a means for the consumer to acquire a prepaid account by telephone or electronically principally in a foreign language. However, foreign language pre-acquisition disclosures are not required for payroll card accounts and government benefit accounts where the foreign language is offered by telephone via a real-time language interpretation service provided by a third party or by the employer or government agency on an informal or ad hoc basis as an accommodation to prospective payroll card account or government benefit account holders.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="b-9-ii" id="b-9-ii"><strong>(ii) Long form disclosures in English upon request.</strong> A financial institution required to provide pre-acquisition disclosures in a foreign language pursuant to paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section must also provide the information required to be disclosed in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section in English upon a consumer’s request and on any part of the Web site where it discloses this information in a foreign language.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-c-Interp-1" id="18-c-Interp-1">1. <strong>Posted transactions.</strong> The electronic and written history of the consumer’s account transactions provided under §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and (iii), respectively, shall reflect transfers once they have been posted to the account. Thus, a financial institution does not need to include transactions that have been authorized but that have not yet posted to the account.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-c-Interp-2" id="18-c-Interp-2">2. <strong>Electronic history.</strong> The electronic history required under §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(ii) must be made available in a form that the consumer may keep, as required under §&#160;1005.4(a)(1). Financial institutions may satisfy this requirement if they make the electronic history available in a format that is capable of being retained. For example, a financial institution satisfies the requirement if it provides electronic history on a website in a format that is capable of being printed or stored electronically using a web browser.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-c-Interp-3" id="18-c-Interp-3">3. <strong>Written history.</strong> Requests that exceed the requirements of §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(iii) for providing written account transaction history, and which therefore a financial institution may charge a fee, include the following:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-c-Interp-3-i" id="18-c-Interp-3-i">i. A financial institution may assess a fee or charge to a consumer for responding to subsequent requests for written account transaction history made in a single calendar month. For example, if a consumer requests written account transaction history on June 1 and makes another request on August 5, the financial institution may not assess a fee or charge to the consumer for responding to either request. However, if the consumer requests written account transaction history on June 1 and then makes another request on June 15, the financial institution may assess a fee or charge to the consumer for responding to the request made on June 15, as this is the second response in the same month.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-c-Interp-3-ii" id="18-c-Interp-3-ii">ii. If a financial institution maintains more than 24 months of written account transaction history, it may assess a fee or charge to the consumer for providing a written history for transactions occurring more than 24 months preceding the date the financial institution receives the consumer’s request, provided the consumer specifically requests the written account transaction history for that time period.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-c-Interp-3-iii" id="18-c-Interp-3-iii">iii. If a financial institution offers a consumer the ability to request automatic mailings of written account transaction history on a monthly or other periodic basis, it may assess a fee or charge for such automatic mailings but not for the written account transaction history requested pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(iii). <em>See</em> comment 18(c)–6.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-c-Interp-4" id="18-c-Interp-4">4. <strong>12 months of electronic account transaction history.</strong> Section 1005.18(c)(1)(ii) requires a financial institution to make available at least 12 months of account transaction history electronically. If a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 12 months, the financial institution need only provide electronic account transaction history pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(ii) since the time of account opening. If a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, as defined by the financial institution, the financial institution need not make available electronic account transaction history. <em>See</em> comment 9(b)–3. If an inactive account becomes active, the financial institution must again make available 12 months of electronic account transaction history.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-c-Interp-5" id="18-c-Interp-5">5. <strong>24 months of written account transaction history.</strong> Section 1005.18(c)(1)(iii) requires a financial institution to provide at least 24 months of account transaction history in writing upon the consumer’s request. A financial institution may provide fewer than 24 months of written account transaction history if the consumer requests a shorter period of time. If a prepaid account has been opened for fewer than 24 months, the financial institution need only provide written account transaction history pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(iii) since the time of account opening. Even if a prepaid account is closed or becomes inactive, the financial institution must continue to provide upon request at least 24 months of written account transaction history preceding the date the request is received. When a prepaid account has been closed or inactive for 24 months or longer, the financial institution is no longer required to provide any written account transaction history pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-c-Interp-6" id="18-c-Interp-6">6. <strong>Periodic statement alternative for unverified prepaid accounts.</strong> For prepaid accounts that are not payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts, a financial institution is not required to provide a written history of the consumer’s account transactions for any prepaid account for which the financial institution has not completed its consumer identification and verification process as described in §&#160;1005.18(e)(3)(ii)(A) through (C). If a prepaid account is verified, a financial institution must provide written account transaction history upon the consumer’s request that includes the period during which the account was not verified, provided that the period is within the 24-month time frame specified in §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-c-Interp-7" id="18-c-Interp-7">7. <strong>Inclusion of all fees charged.</strong> A financial institution that furnishes a periodic statement pursuant to §&#160;1005.9(b) for a prepaid account must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for electronic fund transfers or otherwise, on the periodic statement as well as on any electronic or written account transaction history the financial institution makes available or provides to the consumer. For example, if a financial institution sends periodic statements and also makes available the consumer’s electronic account transaction history on its website, the financial institution must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for electronic fund transfers or otherwise, on the periodic statement and on the consumer’s electronic account transaction history made available on its website. Likewise, a financial institution that follows the periodic statement alternative in §&#160;1005.18(c)(1) must disclose the amount of any fees assessed against the account, whether for electronic fund transfers or otherwise, on the electronic history of the consumer’s account transactions made available pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and any written history of the consumer’s account transactions provided pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(iii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-c-Interp-8" id="18-c-Interp-8">8. <strong>Summary totals of fees.</strong> Section 1005.18(c)(5) requires a financial institution to disclose a summary total of the amount of all fees assessed by the financial institution against a prepaid account for the prior calendar month and for the calendar year to date.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-c-Interp-8-i" id="18-c-Interp-8-i">i. <strong>Generally.</strong> A financial institution that furnishes a periodic statement pursuant to §&#160;1005.9(b) for a prepaid account must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the periodic statement as well as on any electronic or written account transaction history the financial institution makes available or provides to the consumer. For example, if a financial institution sends periodic statements and also makes available the consumer’s electronic account transaction history on its website, the financial institution must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the periodic statement and on the consumer’s electronic account transaction history made available on its website. Likewise, a financial institution that follows the periodic statement alternative in §&#160;1005.18(c)(1) must display the monthly and annual fee totals on the electronic history of the consumer’s account transactions made available pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(ii) and any written history of the consumer’s account transactions provided pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(iii). If a financial institution provides periodic statements pursuant to §&#160;1005.9(b), fee totals may be disclosed for each statement period rather than each calendar month, if different. The summary totals of fees should be net of any fee reversals.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-c-Interp-8-ii" id="18-c-Interp-8-ii">ii. <strong>Third-party fees.</strong> A financial institution may, but is not required to, include third-party fees in its summary totals of fees provided pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(c)(5). For example, a financial institution must include in the summary totals of fees the fee it charges a consumer for using an out-of-network ATM, but it need not include any fee charged by an ATM operator, with whom the financial institution has no relationship, for the consumer’s use of that operator’s ATM. Similarly, a financial institution need not include in the summary totals of fees the fee charged by a third-party reload network for the service of adding cash to a prepaid account at a point-of-sale terminal. A financial institution may, but is not required to, inform consumers of third-party fees such as by providing a disclaimer to indicate that the summary totals do not include certain third-party fees or to explain when third-party fees may occur or through some other method.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-c-Interp-9" id="18-c-Interp-9">9. <strong>Display of summary totals of fees.</strong> A financial institution may, but is not required to, also include sub-totals of the types of fees that make up the summary totals of fees as required by §&#160;1005.18(c)(5). For example, if a financial institution distinguishes optional fees (e.g., custom card design fees) from fees to use the account, in displaying the summary totals of fees, the financial institution may include sub-totals of those fees, provided the financial institution also presents the combined totals of all fees.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-e-Interp-1" id="18-e-Interp-1">1. <strong>Error resolution safe harbor provision.</strong> Institutions that choose to investigate notices of error provided up to 120 days from the date a transaction has posted to a consumer’s account may still disclose the error resolution time period required by the regulation (as set forth in the model clause in paragraph (b) of appendix A–7 of this part). Specifically, an institution may disclose to prepaid account holders that the institution will investigate any notice of error provided within 60 days of the consumer electronically accessing an account or receiving a written history upon request that reflects the error, even if, for some or all transactions, the institution investigates any notice of error provided up to 120 days from the date that the transaction alleged to be in error has posted to the consumer’s account. Similarly, an institution’s summary of the consumer’s liability (as required under §&#160;1005.7(b)(1)) may disclose that liability is based on the consumer providing notice of error within 60 days of the consumer electronically accessing an account or receiving a written history reflecting the error, even if, for some or all transactions, the institution allows a consumer to assert a notice of error up to 120 days from the date of posting of the alleged error.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-e-Interp-2" id="18-e-Interp-2">2. <strong>Electronic access.</strong> A consumer is deemed to have accessed a prepaid account electronically when the consumer enters a user identification code or password or otherwise complies with a security procedure used by an institution to verify the consumer’s identity and to provide access to a website or mobile application through which account information can be viewed. An institution is not required to determine whether a consumer has in fact accessed information about specific transactions to trigger the beginning of the 60-day periods for liability limits and error resolution under §§&#160;1005.6 and 1005.11. A consumer is not deemed to have accessed a prepaid account electronically when the consumer receives an automated text message or other automated account alert, or checks the account balance by telephone.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-e-Interp-3" id="18-e-Interp-3">3. <strong>Untimely notice of error.</strong> An institution that provides a transaction history under §&#160;1005.18(c)(1) is not required to comply with the requirements of §&#160;1005.11 for any notice of error from the consumer received more than 60 days after the earlier of the date the consumer electronically accesses the account transaction history or the date the financial institution sends a written account transaction history upon the consumer’s request. (Alternatively, as provided in §&#160;1005.18(e)(2)(ii), an institution need not comply with the requirements of §&#160;1005.11 with respect to any notice of error received from the consumer more than 120 days after the date of posting of the transfer allegedly in error.) Where the consumer’s assertion of error involves an unauthorized EFT, however, the institution must comply with §&#160;1005.6 (including the extension of time limits in §&#160;1005.6(b)(4)) before it may impose any liability on the consumer.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-e-Interp-4" id="18-e-Interp-4">4. <strong>Verification of accounts.</strong> Section 1005.18(e)(3)(i) provides that for prepaid accounts that are not payroll card accounts or government benefit accounts, a financial institution is not required to comply with the liability limits and error resolution requirements in §§&#160;1005.6 and 1005.11 for any prepaid account for which it has not successfully completed its consumer identification and verification process. Consumer identifying information may include the consumer’s full name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number or other government-issued identification number. Section 1005.18(e)(3)(iii) provides that once a financial institution successfully completes its consumer identification and verification process with respect to a prepaid account, the financial institution must limit the consumer’s liability for unauthorized transfers and resolve errors that occur following verification in accordance with §&#160;1005.6 or §&#160;1005.11, or the modified timing requirements in §&#160;1005.18(e), as applicable. A financial institution is not required to limit a consumer’s liability for unauthorized transfers or resolve errors that occur prior to the financial institution’s successful completion of its consumer identification and verification process with respect to a prepaid account.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-e-Interp-5" id="18-e-Interp-5">5. <strong>Financial institution has not successfully completed verification.</strong> Section 1005.18(e)(3)(ii)(A) states that, provided it discloses to the consumer the risks of not registering and verifying a prepaid account, a financial institution has not successfully completed its consumer identification and verification process where it has not concluded the process with respect to a particular prepaid account. For example, a financial institution initiates its consumer identification and verification process by collecting identifying information about a consumer, and attempts to verify the consumer’s identity. The financial institution is unable to conclude the process because of conflicting information about the consumer’s current address. The financial institution informs the consumer about the nature of the information at issue and requests additional documentation, but the consumer does not provide the requested documentation. As long as the information needed to complete the verification process remains outstanding, the financial institution has not concluded its consumer identification and verification process with respect to that consumer. A financial institution may not delay completing its consumer identification and verification process or refuse to verify a consumer’s identity based on the consumer’s assertion of an error.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-0" data-label="18-e-Interp-6" id="18-e-Interp-6">6. <strong>Account verification prior to acquisition.</strong> A financial institution that collects and verifies consumer identifying information, or that obtains such information after it has been collected and verified by a third party, prior to or as part of the account acquisition process, is deemed to have successfully completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to that account. For example, a university contracts with a financial institution to disburse financial aid to students via the financial institution’s prepaid accounts. To facilitate the accurate disbursal of aid awards, the university provides the financial institution with identifying information about the university’s students, whose identities the university had previously verified. The financial institution is deemed to have successfully completed its consumer identification and verification process with respect to those accounts.</p>

Section 1005.18(b)(4)(ii) requires a financial institution to disclose in its pre-acquisition long form disclosure all fees imposed in connection with a prepaid account. Section 1005.18(b)(4) also contains several specific statements that must be provided as part of the long form disclosure. A financial institution may, but is not required to, disclose the information required by §&#160;1005.18(b)(4) in accordance with the formatting, grouping, size and other requirements set forth in §&#160;1005.18(b) for the long form disclosure as part of its initial disclosures provided pursuant to §&#160;1005.7; a financial institution may choose to do so, however, in order to satisfy other requirements in §&#160;1005.18. <em>See, e.g.</em>, §&#160;1005.18(b)(1)(ii) regarding the retail location exception.</p>

A disclosure made on an accompanying document, such as a terms and conditions document, on packaging material surrounding an access device, or on a sticker or other label affixed to an access device does not constitute a disclosure on the access device. The financial institution must provide this information to allow consumers to, for example, contact the financial institution to learn about the terms and conditions of the prepaid account, obtain prepaid account balance information, request a copy of transaction history pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(iii) if the financial institution does not provide periodic statements pursuant to §&#160;1005.9(b), or to notify the financial institution when the consumer believes that an unauthorized electronic fund transfer has occurred as required by §§&#160;1005.7(b)(2) and 1005.18(d)(1)(ii).</p>

Section 1005.18(g) applies to account terms, conditions, and features that apply to the asset feature of the prepaid account. Section 1005.18(g) does not apply to the account terms, conditions, or features that apply to the covered separate credit feature, regardless of whether it is structured as a separate credit account or as a credit subaccount of the prepaid account that is separate from the asset feature of the prepaid account.</p>

For example, the terms may differ between a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card is not offered in connection with any prepaid accounts within the prepaid account program, and a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be offered to some consumers in connection with their prepaid accounts.</p>

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-g-Interp-5-i" id="18-g-Interp-5-i">i. With respect to a prepaid account program where consumers may be offered a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined by Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, §&#160;1005.18(g) only permits a financial institution to charge the same or higher fees on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of a comparable fee it charges on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have a such a credit feature. Section 1005.18(g) prohibits a financial institution from imposing a lower fee or charge on prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature than the amount of a comparable fee or charge it charges on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program without such a credit feature. With regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, a fee or charge imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account generally is a finance charge under Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) to the extent that the amount of the fee or charge exceeds the amount of a comparable fee or charge imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that do not have such a credit feature. <em>See</em> Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). With regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, this comment below provides illustrations of how §&#160;1005.18(g) applies to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account. The term “non-covered separate credit feature” refers to a separate credit feature that is not accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-g-Interp-5-ii" id="18-g-Interp-5-ii">ii. The following examples illustrate how §&#160;1005.18(g) applies to per transaction fees for each transaction to access funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-g-Interp-5-ii-A" id="18-g-Interp-5-ii-A">A. Assume that a consumer has selected a prepaid account program where a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card may be offered. For prepaid accounts without such a credit feature, the financial institution charges $0.50 for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the prepaid account. For prepaid accounts with a credit feature, the financial institution also charges $0.50 on the asset feature for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account. In this case, for purposes of §&#160;1005.18(g), the financial institution is imposing the same fee for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account, regardless of whether the prepaid account has a covered separate credit feature accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card. Also, with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as those terms are defined in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61, the $0.50 per transaction fee imposed on the asset feature for each transaction that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account is not a finance charge under 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii). <em>See</em> Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii) and comment 4(b)(11)(ii)–1, for a discussion of the definition of finance charge with respect to fees or charges imposed on the asset feature of a prepaid account with regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account that are both accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in 12 CFR 1026.61.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-g-Interp-5-ii-B" id="18-g-Interp-5-ii-B">B. Same facts as in paragraph A, except that for prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature, the financial institution imposes a $1.25 fee for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account. In this case, the financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under §&#160;1005.18(g)(2) on prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature than it charges on prepaid accounts without such a credit feature. The $0.75 excess is a finance charge under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii).</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-g-Interp-5-ii-C" id="18-g-Interp-5-ii-C">C. Same facts as in paragraph A, except that for prepaid accounts with a covered separate credit feature, the financial institution imposes a $0.25 fee for each transaction conducted that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid account. In this case, the financial institution is in violation of §&#160;1005.18(g) because it is imposing a lower fee on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature than it imposes on prepaid accounts in the same program without such a credit feature.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-g-Interp-5-iii" id="18-g-Interp-5-iii">iii. Where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct person-to-person transfers, any per transaction fees imposed on the asset feature of prepaid accounts, including load and transfer fees, with such a credit feature are comparable only to per transaction fees for each transaction to access funds in the asset feature of a prepaid account that are imposed on prepaid accounts in the same prepaid account program that does not have such a credit feature. Per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted to load or draw funds into a prepaid account from a source other than the funds in the asset feature are not comparable for purposes of §&#160;1005.18(g). To illustrate:</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-g-Interp-5-iii-A" id="18-g-Interp-5-iii-A">A. Assume a financial institution charges $0.50 on prepaid accounts for each transaction that accesses funds in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Also, assume that the financial institution charges $0.50 per transaction on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, for purposes of §&#160;1005.18(g), the financial institution is imposing the same fee for each transaction it pays, regardless of whether the transaction accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature, or is paid from credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of authorizing, settling, or otherwise completing a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct person-to-person transfers. Also, for purposes of Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.4(b)(11)(ii), the $0.50 per transaction fee imposed on the asset feature of the prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature is not a finance charge.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-g-Interp-5-iii-B" id="18-g-Interp-5-iii-B">B.

Assume also that the financial institution charges both a $0.50 per transaction fee and a $1.25 transfer fee on the asset feature of prepaid accounts in the same prepaid program where the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses credit from a covered separate credit feature in the course of a transaction. In this case, both fees charged on a per-transaction basis for the credit transaction (i.e., a combined fee of $1.75 per transaction) must be compared to the $0.50 per transaction fee to access funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature. The financial institution is permitted to charge a higher fee under §&#160;1005.18(g) for transactions that access the covered separate credit feature in the course of the transaction than the amount of the comparable fee it charges for each transaction that accesses funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts without such a credit feature.

<p class="regdown-block level-2" data-label="18-g-Interp-5-iii-E" id="18-g-Interp-5-iii-E">E. Assume same facts as in paragraph D above, except that assume the financial institution also charges a load fee of $1.25 whenever funds are transferred or loaded from a separate asset account, such as from a deposit account via a debit card, in the course of a transaction on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature, in addition to charging a $0.50 per transaction fee. In this case, both fees charged on a per-transaction basis for the credit transaction (i.e., a combined fee of $1.75 per transaction) must be compared to the per transaction fee (i.e., the fee of $0.50) to access funds available in the asset feature of the prepaid accounts on a prepaid account without a covered separate credit feature. Per transaction fees for a transaction that is conducted by drawing funds into a prepaid account from some other source (i.e., the fee of $1.25) are not comparable for purposes of §&#160;1005.18(g).

<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-g-Interp-5-iv" id="18-g-Interp-5-iv">iv. A consumer may choose in a particular circumstance to draw or transfer credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or service, obtain cash, or conduct person-to-person transfers. For example, a consumer may use the prepaid card at the financial institution’s Web site to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction conducted with the card to obtain goods or services, obtain cash, or conduct person-to-person transfers. <em>See</em> Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.61(a)(2)(i)(B) and comment 61(a)(2)–4.ii. In these situations, load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction are compared only with fees, if any, to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature. Fees imposed on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature for a one-time load or transfer of funds from a separate asset account or from a non-covered separate credit feature are not comparable for purposes of §&#160;1005.18(g).

Assume the financial institution charges $1.25 on the asset feature of a prepaid account with a covered separate credit feature to load funds from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction. In this case, the load or transfer fees imposed for draws or transfers of credit from the covered separate credit feature outside the course of a transaction (i.e., the fee of $1.25) is compared with the fees to load funds as a direct deposit of salary from an employer or a direct deposit of government benefits that are charged on prepaid accounts without a covered separate credit feature (i.e., the fee of $0).

For example, a financial institution that had been retaining only 60 days of account history before April 1, 2019 would provide 60 days of written account transaction history upon a consumer’s request on April 1, 2019. If, on May 1, 2019, the consumer made another request for written account transaction history, the financial institution would be required to provide three months of account history. The financial institution must continue to provide as much account history as it has accumulated at the time of a consumer’s request until it has accumulated 24 months of account history. Thus, all financial institutions must fully comply with the electronic account transaction history requirement set forth in §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(ii) no later than April 1, 2020 and must fully comply with the written account transaction history requirement set forth in §&#160;1005.18(c)(1)(iii) no later than April 1, 2021.</p>
<p class="regdown-block level-1" data-label="18-h-Interp-6-ii" id="18-h-Interp-6-ii">ii. <strong>Summary totals of fees.</strong> A financial institution must display a summary total of the amount of all fees assessed by the financial institution on the consumer’s prepaid account for the prior calendar month and for the calendar year to date pursuant to §&#160;1005.18(c)(5) beginning April 1, 2019. If, on April 1, 2019, the financial institution does not have readily accessible the data necessary to calculate the summary totals of fees for the prior calendar month or the calendar year to date, the financial institution may provide the summary totals using the data it has until the financial institution has accumulated the data necessary to display the summary totals as required by §&#160;1005.18(c)(5). That is, the financial institution would first display the monthly fee total beginning on May 1, 2019 for the month of April, and the year-to-date fee total beginning on April 1, 2019, provided the financial institution discloses that it is displaying the year-to-date total beginning on April 1, 2019 rather than for the entire calendar year 2019. On January 1, 2020, financial institutions must begin displaying year-to-date fee totals for calendar year 2020.</p>
